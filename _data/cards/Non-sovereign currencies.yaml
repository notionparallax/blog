  - Money developed as a special case of any unit of exchange. That could be sheep,
    cows and camels, or silver and gold. At some point someone made an object that
    stood in for the direct value of those objects and that became the money that
    we recognise today.
  - Most money these days is backed by a national bank. Non-sovereign currency means
    that it isn't backed that way by a government. This could be Linden Dollars[^43]
    that are spent inside the game Second Life, but the first thing that most people
    think of is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the most famous of a whole class of cryptocurrencies.
    Cryptocurrencies are 'mined' through cryptographic algorithms that control the
    production rate of the 'coins'.
  - If currency is decoupled from national borders and from governments it takes away
    one of the most powerful levers that governments have to affect their country.
    It results in a much 'purer' expression of market forces. The positive or negative
    effects of this are unknown.

- If nations don't control money, how will they generate trust?
- What will it mean for taxation?
- What does this mean for markets?
- What will it mean for crime? Black and grey economies often operate on a cash only
  basis[^44].
- How will we manage the volatility?
