        - Cities and suburbs are looking for places to downshift development and add
          urban greenery[^urbanGreenery] to compensate for rising C0<sub>2</sub> emissions. Especially
          if carbon sequestration is eventually monetized, this could have an impact on
          land use overall, since owning undeveloped forest land would be profitable. This
          may point to a shift away from increasingly elusive home ownership toward permaculture
          land ownership.
