        - Generally, crime and violence seems to be declining overall[^24] [^25]. This may
          be because of better policing, or more surveillance. It could just be that we
          are generally richer, and therefore we feel less compelled to risk committing
          crimes to obtain what we don't have.

consider:
    - How much crime went unreported in the past? Has this amount increased or decreased?
    - Has the Overton window moved to include new acts within the definition of _violence_?
    - Are we less violent because we have 'advanced' as a society, or because we are more
      afraid of getting caught?
