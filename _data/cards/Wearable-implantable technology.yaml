        - We are in the first flush of the wearable technology boom[^41]. The quantified
          self that knowing your steps and heart rate allows for means that people can make
          more informed choices about their behaviour.
        - "We are currently in a very na\xC3\xAFve period of this trend. The things we measure\
          \ aren't the important things, they are the things that are easy to measure. The\
          \ feedback we get is distracting and doesn't allow us to be more present in our\
          \ lives. In the next generation of wearable, or even implantable, technology,\
          \ we'll be able to use it to maximise our health and wellbeing, and to be far\
          \ more present than we currently are."

consider:
    - What else could you measure and what would be the best way to do it?
    - What would you do with that data?
    - Who else would like to know that information about you?
    - Are you keen to become a cyborg?
    - What information would you worry about if it was leaked?
