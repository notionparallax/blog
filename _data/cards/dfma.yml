        - Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA) is a product design approach that was developed in the manufacturing industries as a way of linking the design and production processes of product development. DfMA captures production data and makes it accessible to the design team in the form of design principles and guides, and metrics for design evaluation and improvement. The aim is to create designs that are efficient, fast, and cost effective to produce. DfMA advocates: modularity and standardisation of parts and processes; simplicity in design; connection interfaces that cannot be assembled incorrectly; part count reduction (as fewer parts as possible); and an emphasis on maintaining good visual and physical access to all connection points (think IKEA!). 
        - In the last decade, the construction industry has turned its attention to DfMA as a potential solution to its productivity crisis. Although some of the DfMA design rules (and most of the DfMA metrics) used in manufacturing are not completely appropriate for use in the design of buildings, DfMA as a philosophy certainly is, especially when paired with prefabrication. The development of a construction-specific DfMA represents a shift towards data-informed design. The construction industry will need to increase the sophistication of its data collection methods during building production/construction phases so that an appropriate set of design guides and evaluation metrics can be developed.

    - In the 2030s 6G will bring even faster connections, what will that allow
    - If you don't need to re-cable, what will this mean for factories? For offices?
