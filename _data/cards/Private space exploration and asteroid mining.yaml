  - Asteroids are mainly made of nickel iron or frozen water. They also contain a
    lot of platinum group metals. They are easy to mine because they don't have big
    gravity wells that need to be overcome.
  - Water is important to space travel because humans need to drink it, but unmanned
    missions need water too because it can be split into rocket fuel. Launching things
    into space is really expensive, so if it's possible to build spacecraft from things
    already in space it's much cheaper.
  - The availability of precious metals in asteroids could upset the world economy
    in the same way that the influx of silver from South America caused massive inflation
    in the 15<sup>th</sup>&ndash;17<sup>th</sup> century[^52].

consider:
- If you hollow out an asteroid what could you do with it?
- Platinum is used as a catalyst in chemical reactions. Making it a lot cheaper would
  make a lot of these applications more viable. What sorts of things could we do if
  the cost of platinum went down?
- What could you do with a million tonnes of water in space?
- Getting raw materials into space is expensive. What could you use the iron in an
  asteroid for?
