  paragraphs:
  - Life expectancy continues to increase[^4] in contrast to Hobbes' idea of life,
    which was "Nasty brutish and short". We are comfortably on track to hit an average
    life expectancy of 100. There is a lot of variation in global life expectancy.
    That average of 100 means that there will be a global reduction in lifespan inequality,
    or that some nations will see huge lifespan increases. It's not uncommon to see
    claims that some children alive today will live to be 150[^5] or 200[^6]!
  - Life expectancy is measured at different ages. These days, in 'developed' countries
    the difference between life expectancy at birth and at five years isn't substantially
    different. Some believe that prehistoric humans could expect to live into their
    mid fifties[^7] if they made it through childhood.

consider:
- Will life expectancy rise equally all over the world?
- Will people work for longer in their life?
- Will people maintain a single career? Does their degree from 1990 have any validity
  in 2050[^8]?
- Will there be a modern equivalent to coopers and farriers needing to find new careers
  during their lifetimes?
