<p>In a crushing moment of feeling old, I realised that it was only fluke that they knew what a floppy disk looked like. It'd be like someone telling me that I needed to look for the 8Track, I know what it is, but i have no idea what it looks like!It just set me wondering if this whole thing has taken on a life of it's own like letter forms going from pictograms into Assyrian (there's great diagram on p112 of David Crystal's excellent book - How Language Works) .</p>
<p>Are we going to have a generation, lets say today's 10 year olds, coming through in a few years that know exactly what a save icon looks like, but no idea what it depicts, it's just the symbol for save?</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bigfolder.png" alt="shamelessly stolen from http://www.nitrodesign.com/designforlife/?p=20" width="256" align="left" />I had a  quick look around, and I found an alternative icon for save, but as floppies disappear from our collective conscience, perhaps too will manilla folders.</p>
<p>Is it necessary for the images depicted in icons to remain contemporary, or is it sufficient that the icon's intention remains intact, and the meaning can become obsolete?</p>

<p>John sent me this scanned article from about the same time as I wrote this. It says more or less the same as I did. John, if you can remember where it came from then let me know.</p>
