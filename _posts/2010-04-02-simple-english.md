<p>I'm going to start a new 'idea auditing' process for my thoughts. English Wikipedia has a parallel site in a language called <a title="Simple English Wikipedia" href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_English_Wikipedia">Simple English</a>. In the explanation page the quote is "_The language is simple, but the ideas don't have to be_".</p>
<p>The articles are written using a <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_write_Simple_English_pages#Basic_English_and_VOA_Special_English">somewhat restricted word list</a>, and it should force me to think clearly about what I really mean.</p>
<p>I've found that when I explain something in simple terms, I generally gain a better understanding of it, which allows me to put the richness back in with the complete range of expression offered by unrestricted use of English.</p>
<p>Anyone else up for joining in?</p>
