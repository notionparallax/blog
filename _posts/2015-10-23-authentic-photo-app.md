<p>There seems to be a widespread obsession with "authenticity" at the moment. I think it might be the next "natural ingredients"[1. rather than supernatural ingredients?]. Having just been on an extremely long holiday I've seen a lot of people posing really hard to get their _authentic_ selfies just right. There's a lot of work that goes into curating a perfect life. It seems to <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html">harm that the people that observe only the _most perfect_ snippets of that person's life</a> too. What about an app that makes the <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/05/what-is-signaling.html">cost of signalling</a> that perfect life a bit higher?</p>
<p>My first crack the problem is to treat it like Instagram, but make it super stripped back; just photos and videos. The key move is that whenever you take a picture, the app also includes 2 seconds of video either side. Then someone can see a perfectly posed photo, but if you swipe it left or right it moves through the process of pulling that crazy duck face if you are a fraud, or of you having a great time if you are "authentic".</p>
<p>I still don't know what authentic really means when used to describe something like an experience, but this seems to be able to at least give a sense of it.</p>
