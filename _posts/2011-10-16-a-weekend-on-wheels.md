<p>I had a bit of mixed weekend of cycling. Friday night was the <acronym title="Bicycle film festival">BFF</acronym> Goldsprints, and after doing OK in last years event I felt that I ought to give it a go.</p>

There really should be an iframe here :(

<p>I was first up and was drawn against Royce. I went back into the zone and did a time that stood unbeaten for a few hours; until all the serious riders got back from the opera house. Somehow I got through the quarters and then got beaten in the semis by Nathan, who then went on to win the whole thing. (Which sounds grander than it should as on times I'm certain that I  didn't do the second fastest time!)</p>
<p>Sunday was the Spring Cycle, and the first 10km or so were great, an amazing city course, but then I had 2 flats simultaneously, and then a broken chain ended it for me at Rhodes. Cue lots of sleeping!</p>
