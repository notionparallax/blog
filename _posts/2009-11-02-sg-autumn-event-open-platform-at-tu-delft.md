<p><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/OpenPlatformPoster.jpg" alt="sg poster" width="300" height="284" /> There is going to be a Smart geometry workshop at the end of this month at TU Delft.<br />
I'm going to be there as a tutor (I think) and it looks like it is going to be really interesting.<br />
See below for the full details, but if you want to go, apply soon as it is going to be popular!</p>
<hr />
<p>The SmartGeometry Group is now accepting applications for...</p>
<p>**Open Platform**</p>
<p>A 3-day Workshop at TU Delft University             _27th-29th November_</p>
<p>This event will complement SmartGeometry's annual workshop and conference event, bringing many of SmartGeometry's experienced tutors to guide participants in exploring computational design through a variety of technologies.</p>
<p><a href="/sites/default/files/OpenPlatformPoster.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to view the Event Poster</a></p>
<p>The event will run in two parallel streams: one stream will feature training in Generative Components (GC) and Grasshopper, while the second will be a workshop where participants have the opportunity to propose and work on individual design projects using a variety of software platforms. Both streams will offer participants close interaction with tutors from practices and universities known for their accomplishments in computational design and analysis, and complex geometry. Additionally, the stream featuring GC and Grasshopper will feature tutors from the companies behind each platform, Bentley and McNeel. Those working on individual projects will need to be proficient in their chosen platform but can draw on tutor's skills in various technologies -- for instance Processing, C++/OpenGL, RhinoScript -- as well as tutors' expertise in complex problems of geometry, structure, algorithms, and analysis. Participants will be able to change streams as it suits the development of their work.</p>
<p>In the evenings, participants can attend presentations demonstrating the latest projects and research in computational architecture and engineering. </p>
<p>**Fees for participation are as follows:**</p>
<p>Students/Academics = 75 euros</p>
<p>Professionals = 200 euros</p>
<p>_Fees cover training and/or workshop room, and evening presentations._</p>
<p>**To register send an email to <a href="mailto:applications@smartgeometry.org">applications@smartgeometry.org</a> with the following information:**</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Email Address</p>
<p>Physical Address</p>
<p>Telephone number</p>
<p>Affiliation</p>
<p>Are you a student or professional?</p>
<p>Order of preference between: Grasshopper Training, GenerativeComponents Training, or Open Workshop. _If you can/want to only attend one in particular, please list only that option._</p>
<p>**The deadline for applications is November 15th.**</p>
<p>All applicants will be notified on their acceptance on November 18th and to arrange fee payment.</p>
