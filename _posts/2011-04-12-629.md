<p>Last week I was invited to help out with some crits at Oxford Brookes for DS6 by Toby Shew. I took some notes, so I thought I'd share them here. I must apologise to the last few students as they didn't get notes because my battery ran out.</p>

<p>As always, it was lovely to be back on home turf, and I hope that these scrawlings are useful.</p>
