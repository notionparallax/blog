<p>Notes from the conference</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Cloud 9 - Enric Ruiz Geli</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://studiobanana.tv/2010/10/11/villa-nurbs-enric-ruiz-geli/">Cloud house in bcn, nurbs house</a>.</li>
<li>Hydrogen lobby</li>
<li>We have ceded design to mega corps, in the past "I'm not sure what I'm doing but I'm doing speed"</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Airship_Hangar.jpg"><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Airship_Hangar.jpg" alt="" width="100" /></a> What would the door to a zeppelin factory like?<br />
<a href="http://obviousmag.org/en/archives/2008/12/airship_hangars.html"><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/08011105_blog.uncovering.org_hangar-tustin.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a><br />
Same scale could build buildings inside that factory.</li>
<li>"_when beauty emerges, every body gets sleepy_"</li>
<li>Doesn't seem to be interested in manufacturing optimisation</li>
<li>Using a projector to check positioning of parts</li>
<li>"_Architects as a platform for contemporary art_"</li>
<li>Still more talk of innovation : but nobody is really talking about how to achieve it, just that it is a good thing, some sort of nebulous good</li>
<li>"it's not like materials are here to fight with us... We should play with them"</li>
<li>"Attack"</li>
</ul>
<h2>bio tic building</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Edifici-Media-TIC.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>No oil, but we have software</li>
<li>All surrounding buildings are not really built the way they look</li>
<li>150kg of people/m<sup>2</sup> 800kg of structure wtf</li>
<li>"looks like, performs, is" "perform, look, one"</li>
<li>1:1 weight to function ratio</li>
<li>Less weight means less cost of foundations, saves money for other parts of the building</li>
<li><a href="http://issuu.com/actar/docs/media-ict/31">Top truss lifted on the rest of the structure of the building</a>.</li>
<li>60% of Spanish energy is imported gas (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/factsheets/mix/mix_es_en.pdf">figures here don't seem to support this though</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.neuberger-gmbh.at/sato/SatronikDD.htm">Satronik</a> d 6000, plasma cutter?</li>
<li>60 companies in Cat doing digital fab, who's doing digital fab in NSW?</li>
<li>Move fees to architect to reduce steel kg, how do you write that contract? A bit like <a href="http://www.akt-uk.com/">akt</a></li>
<li>"stay in the bubble, continues dumb"</li>
<li>Hang the building to produce emptiness</li>
<li>When asked to draw what is missing they all draw columns (8 yr olds) we have constructed their reality</li>
<li>"4 technologies for 4 energy diagrams of a building"</li>
<li>Each etfe pillow component is smart arduino driven, 0.3% of the cost of the building</li>
<li><a href="http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/?p=11018"><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/92.jpg" alt="" width="100" /></a>Cloud in pillow produces a shadow</li>
<li>Who are the enviro consultants?</li>
<li>7 years to net zero, are we ready? Will this happen in aus? I doubt it</li>
<li>Adding 2 years of monitoring to the contract</li>
<li>Arduinos do distributed decision making, I wonder if they have any oversight possibility?</li>
<li>I wonder if you could mash the DEC database with google maps?</li>
<li>Trees are the Boss of the buildings</li>
</ul>
<h1>clusters:</h1>
<h2><a href="http://smartgeometry.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=132%3Amicro-synergetics&amp;catid=44&amp;Itemid=149">micro synergetics</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Start early and per plan the workshop via skype.</li>
<li>Working with dynamic materials, simulation, micro controllers and user interaction</li>
<li>Each sub component (personal project) is linked/networked into a larger system</li>
<li>Using thermo wires and thermal paint</li>
<li>Everyone seems to prefer to work with grasshopper, is it going to become the ubiquitous platform for everything? Do other fields like grasshopper?</li>
<li>Digitally mediated vs direct material responses? Motors vs shape memory etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>composite territories</h2>
<ul>
<li>Designed materials, micro spec of materials affect macro performance</li>
<li>Simulation and testing</li>
<li>Glass fibre polymer</li>
<li>Programming with making</li>
<li>Working with structure in the surface</li>
<li>A much richer understanding of failure</li>
<li>Using layup to control bending and twisting</li>
<li>Thermo presses, fancy t shirt press/ sandwich press</li>
<li>Design, making, testing (formal), testing (playing), making</li>
<li>Simulation using sofistick, but also using it for design not just verification</li>
<li>The structure has completely stiff, flat and non rotating nodes so that all bending happens in the members.</li>
<li>Questions</li>
<li>Lars: where do you put the intelligence in your intelligent systems?</li>
<li>Much disagreement ensues, but it seems that the one thing that is agreed on is that we ought to move into it in general, and let the balance of things work itself out.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Session 2</h1>
<h2><a title="Faculty page" href="http://www.eng.rpi.edu/soe/index.php/faculty/154?soeid=hullr2">Robert hull</a></h2>

<h2>bioresponsive building envelopes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Responsive pixelated building skins so that the performance changes dependant on whatever factors matter to you</li>
<li>Double pane systems, like etfe pillows, allows directional opacity</li>
</ul>
<p>Material conflicts</p>
<ul>
<li>Rc: as a designer nobody wants to pick over a scatter plot ( why not? Maybe it's just a skill we need to get used to? All visualisations are an abstraction that leaves something out, so maybe we should be making our own abstractions?)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Manfred grohmann</h3>
<ul>
<li>Using reciprocal frames and CNC cutting to make craft joints</li>
<li>Geodesics on a surface to make frames and enclosures (what sorts of surfaces are amenable to this kind of treatment?)</li>

<li>D to p on contractor side</li>
<li>Hermes rive gauch</li>

<li>Mountain rail</li>
<li>Why make complicated details when you can just mill plastic, nicely pragmatic</li>
<li>Statsel museum looks like it well worth a visit</li>
<li>Gtecz.com</li>
<li>Voxeljet 3d concrete printing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Grids hell tectonics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use geodesic curves to get straight unrolls</li>
<li>Complex form with straight members</li>
<li>How to check that it won't sag to failure?</li>
<li>Splicing long pieces</li>
<li>4 layer lath construction</li>
<li>No bin packing due to unknown deliveries, more time and 3% wastage could go down even more maybe?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sg kids</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kids easily understood sketch up</li>

</ul>

<li>Modelling a 60 storey building in a wind tunnel</li>
<li>Playing around in wind tunnel to see what really happens rather than relying on cfd simulation</li>

<li>Using a neural network, but for what end?</li>
</ul>
