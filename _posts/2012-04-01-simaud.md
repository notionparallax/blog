<p>I've just got back from my trip to the states. I went to Smart Geometry in Troy, and then onto SimAud in Orlando. I gave twitter a go, <a title="there is another group on this channel, so ignore student election related stuff!" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23sg2012">SG was pretty enthusiastic</a>, simAUD much less so.</p>

<p>I was just <a title="My notes from the Conference day are here" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2012/03/conference-day/">watching at SG</a> but I was presenting the some of the work that we've been doing at BVN over the last year or so at <acronym title="simulation in architecture and urban design">SimAUD</acronym> under the title of "<a title="PDF download" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/A_Spatial_Query__Analysis_Tool.pdf">A_Spatial_Query_&amp;_Analysis_Tool</a>". This is the pre-press version, so as soon as the proceedings are released I'll put the proper link up and write more about it.</p>
<p>The real reason for this post was to get  <a title="My notes and recordings from evernote" href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s42/sh/70777872-8a9a-4fb2-becf-4c0381e52069/3df2da23e6f291befe9d5b9427a5925d">my notes from SimAUD</a> up online.</p>
