<p>Thanks to everyone who came to todays <a href="http://www.processing.org">processing</a> session.</p>
<p><a href="http://processing.org/learning/drawing/"><img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1.11.jpg" alt="picture of a man made of shapes pinched from Daniel Shiffman's book" width="200" height="200" /></a>The task I set was to make the dude that Daniel Shiffman draws in his example on the <a href="http://processing.org/learning/drawing/"> learning processing page</a> stick to the mouse, and scale with the mouse's position.</p>
<p>Not only that, but to do it in a readable way with minimal use of explicit values so that we can use it to make an object for agent simulations next week.</p>
<p>This isn't easy, so use a lot of sketches, and diagrms on graph paper to help you. A programmers best tool is their brain, and then second best is a notebook!</p>
<p>My example of one way to do it is after the fold. I don't expect you to solve this all on your own (but extra brownie points if you do) so go through my code and get a handle on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an example of one way (there are many) that you could have written your code to allow for the dude to be drawn</p>
<pre name="code" class="java">
void setup()
{
  size(400,400);
  rectMode(CENTER);
}
void draw()
{
  //redraw the background
  background(255,255,255);
  //expose some variables
  int centreLineX = mouseX;
  int bodyCentreY = mouseY;

  //********some internal variables***********
  int headCentreY = bodyCentreY-30;
  int bodyHeight = 100;
  int bodyWidth = 20;
  int headSize = bodyWidth*3;
  int eyeWidth = (headSize/3)-2;
  int legSize = 20;

  //**********draw the dude***************
  //body
  rect(centreLineX, //centroid X
       bodyCentreY, //centroid U
       bodyWidth,
       bodyHeight);
  //head
  ellipse(centreLineX,
          headCentreY,
          headSize,
          headSize);
  //left eye        
  ellipse(centreLineX-19, 
          headCentreY, 
          eyeWidth, 
          headSize/2); 
  //right eye
  ellipse(centreLineX+19, 
          headCentreY, 
          eyeWidth,
          headSize/2); 
  //left leg
  line(centreLineX - (bodyWidth/2),            //startX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight/2),           //startY
       centreLineX - (bodyWidth/2) - legSize,  //endX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight/2) + legSize);//endY
  //right leg       
  line(centreLineX + (bodyWidth/2), 
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight/2),
       centreLineX + (bodyWidth/2) + legSize,
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight/2) + legSize);        
}
</pre>
<p>I've delibearly left out the scaling to keep the code readable in the version above. Here it is with the scaling involved.</p>
<pre name="code" class="java">void setup()
{
  size(800,800);
  rectMode(CENTER);
}
void draw()
{
  //redraw the background
  background(255,255,255);
  //expose some variables
  int centreLineX = mouseX;
  int bodyCentreY = mouseY;
  /* This is the scaling part
   * it is a bit tricky to figure out, but think about 
   * it as a diagram on some graph paper. The mouseX and 
   * mouseY numbers get extremetly large, not very far 
   * away from the origin, so they need to be scaled down 
   * a lot or our man becomes a tiny dot.
   *
   * The +1 is so that when mouseX or mouseY = 0 that we 
   * don't get a 'divide by zero' error*/
  int scaleX = mouseX/100 + 1;
  int scaleY = mouseY/100 + 1;
  
  //some internal variables  
  int headCentreY = bodyCentreY - (30/scaleY);
  int bodyHeight = 100;
  int bodyWidth = 20;
  int headSize = bodyWidth * 3;
  int eyeWidth = (headSize/3)-2;
  int legSize = 20;
  
  //draw the dude
  //body
  rect(centreLineX, //centroid X
       bodyCentreY, //centroid U
       bodyWidth / scaleX,
       bodyHeight / scaleY);
  //head
  ellipse(centreLineX,
          headCentreY,
          headSize / scaleX,
          headSize / scaleY);
  //left eye        
  ellipse(centreLineX - (19 / scaleX), 
          headCentreY, 
          eyeWidth / scaleX, 
          headSize / 2 / scaleY); 
  //right eye
  ellipse(centreLineX + (19 / scaleX), 
          headCentreY, 
          eyeWidth / scaleX,
          headSize / 2 / scaleY); 
  //left leg
  line(centreLineX - (bodyWidth  / 2 / scaleX), //startX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight / 2 / scaleY), //startY
       centreLineX - (bodyWidth  / 2 / scaleX) - legSize / scaleX,  //endX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight / 2 / scaleY) + legSize / scaleY);//endY
  //right leg       
  line(centreLineX + (bodyWidth  / 2 / scaleX), //startX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight / 2 / scaleY), //startY
       centreLineX + (bodyWidth  / 2 / scaleX) + legSize / scaleX,  //endX
       bodyCentreY + (bodyHeight / 2 / scaleY) + legSize / scaleY);//endY       
}
</pre>
<p>If you've got this far, you've done **very** well as this is some tricky stuff!</p>
