<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2793656107_dba10dbc91_m.jpg" align="right" height="240" width="204" />In a past life, I made drinks and witty banter for a living.</p>
<p>These are the two menus that I had the most involvement in making.</p>
<p>some of the jokes are a bit old now, but the drinks are still amazing.</p>
<p>  click on the pics to see them big</p>

<p>Savannah was a bit of a utopian experiment, no jack 7, no Malibu, no archers, nothing crap, organic pouring vodka. Nick Wykes (now of <a href="http://www.ipbartenders.com/about_us.phtml" title="take a look they are a bit flash, no idea what possesed nick to wear that outfit though" target="_blank">IPB</a>) and I  put together  the best menu we could at the time. It was a 1 man bar, maybe 2 at a push, and would probably have worked if the management hadn't have changed and decided that we were doing it all wrong.<br />
I'm going to tidy up the specs for this menu and post them soon.</p>
<p>Mertons was a different kettle of fish, it was a big bar, and we hold the record takes for an evening (at nearly twice the previous record) all the time though, we managed to keep the level of quality high, and have fun at the same time.<br />

It did nearly finish me off though. so I retired.</p>
