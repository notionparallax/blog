I haven't posted for a long time. I've been going through a period of pretty significant latency. Lots of energy has been going into things and nothing has come out of it _yet!_ There's a lot of activity in the draft folders of my life and not a lot getting published. Hopefully that'll change soon!

I'm going to be teaching first year programming for UNSW's [Computational Design](https://www.be.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate-degrees/computational-design/about-computational-design) degree. I'm pretty opinionated about what you need to learn to be a computational designer, and [Hank](https://www.be.unsw.edu.au/profile/matthias-hank_haeusler) has given me a pretty broad remit to teach what I want so I'm really looking forward to it.

The students will be getting geometry and Rhino/Grasshopper skills from their other modules, so I'm focusing on programming. I want to get across to them that there is more to it than just typing in a particular way; that it's a thought discipline. It'll change their brains and make them better able to think about everything else in their world.

It's still a work in progress, but all the course documentation is [here](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161) and the course is being run [out of this repo](https://github.com/notionparallax/code1161base).

There are going to be 3 assignments:
1. [Technical Foundations](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-02-assignment-1-brief)
1. [Holy wars](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-03-assignment-2-brief)
1. [Open Data Project](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-04-assignment-3-brief)

The first half of the course has weekly exercises that are auto going to be auto marked. I've got the first half of that worked out, I can mark my own work, now I just need to automate pulling each student's repo[^git], running the tests against it and keeping track of who's done what.

At the moment, the exercises for weeks 1-4 are done, lecture 1 is mostly done and lecture 2 is stubbed out. There's still a long way to go!

On the plus side, I've got two great tutors helping me ([Aiden](https://www.facebook.com/aiden.ray) and [Ishaan](https://www.facebook.com/ishaan.varshney)) so they'll catch my slip ups.

If you've got any thoughts then do let me know!
