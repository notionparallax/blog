<p>I was always a bit confused by one of  the lyrics of Tricky's _Struglin'_ - "I think I'm more normal than most".</p>
<p>I've just finished the <a title="you can buy it from amazon, woooo" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Statistics-Very-Short-Introduction-Introductions/dp/019923356X">very short introduction to statistics</a>, and now I get it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/moreNormalThanMost.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-482" title="moreNormalThanMost" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/moreNormalThanMost.png" alt="" width="490" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>So the X axis is something, like cleanliness or laziness, and the Y axis is how many people are that clean or lazy.</p>
<p>If the distribution looks like this, then if you are in the middle, then you are more normal than most!</p>
