<p>Christmas is over, countless letters of thanks should probably be written to people who gave you things you didn't really want, but it's all too much of a faff.</p>
<p>At least that's what I was hoping. I thought I'd give Facebook ads another go for <a href="http://postednot.es">postednot.es</a> to try to convince all those intrinsically polite, but lazy people that I could give them just what they needed.</p>
<p class="tldr">Tl;dr: 35% of my budget seems to have gone to Russian bots, and Facebook seems to think that there is nothing they can do about it.</p>
<p>To make a slightly longer version of the Tl;Dr: I was paying about $1 a click, which is fine but 35% of those clicks were coming from a single source in Russia. That person/bot clicked the Facebook advert 25 times on the day in question. My beef is that for all Facebook's fancy data analytics, that they aren't able to filter out that kind of user and keep their advertiser (i.e. me!) a bit happier. I'd love to know if this experience is replicated across other campaigns.</p>
<p>This is basically just me complaining, but it's cathartic.<br />

<p>Most of what follows is methodology and analysis; it's not very exciting. I didn't need to do anything magic to separate the clicks driven by facebook from the ones that came 'organically' as there weren't any of the latter type!</p>

<p>This is what Google Anlytics thinks my traffic has looked like.</p>
<p>The advert is targeted specifically at a UK audience. more specifically:</p>
<div class="demographic">
<h3>Targeting &amp; Placement</h3>
<p>Location: United Kingdom</p>
<p>Interests: Advertising, Lifehacker, Economics or Law</p>
<p>Behaviours: Early technology adopters</p>
<p>Primary Browser: Firefox, Primary Browser: Chrome, Primary Browser: Safari or Primary Browser: Opera</p>
<p>Education Level: At university (postgraduate), Some university (postgraduate), Master's degree or Professional degree</p>
<p>Age: 27–38</p>
<p>Language: English (UK) or English (US)</p>
<p>Mobile Placement: Third-party Apps or News Feed</p>
<p>Desktop: News Feed or Right Column</p>
</div>
<p>So that's a pretty specific bunch.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1732" align="alignnone" width="434"]<img class="wp-image-1732" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2014-12-29-at-9.33.51-am.png" alt="Table of data about source of clicks" width="434" height="319" /> More detailed session information. The plot thickens![/caption]</p>
<p>This is taken from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1396683767238520">Facebook help page</a>:</p>
<div class="fb-help">
<p><a style="color: #3b5998; font-weight: bold;" href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1396683767238520">Why is my third party analytics software showing that my ads were clicked on outside of the location I targeted my ads to?</a></p>
<p>Some third-party analytics software, such as Google Analytics and Omniture (Adobe), may show clicks on your ads from outside of the location you're targeting. This is because these platforms only use a person’s IP address to find a location. If someone is using a VPN, proxy server or even clicking ads from their mobile device, it can hide their true IP address and location.</p>
<p>Facebook can provide more accurate aggregated reporting because we're able to target ads to people based on the data they've added on Facebook, such as their current city, and the locations of their friends.</p>
</div>
<p>So it looks like this is a known thing. I doubt that there are any ways to get Facebook to care about it - but if it happens on a larger scale then I'd imagine that people would get sad if 35% of their ad budget goes to serial clickers in Russia.</p>
