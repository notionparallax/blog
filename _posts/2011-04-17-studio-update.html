<p>My studio has just had what I suppose you could call their mid semester crits.<br />
They've been developing and researching their existential threats over the last few weeks, and this crit was a chance for them to present that work. I was a little surprised by the presentations, this was the first time that i'd seen architecture students presenting a non-architectural topic. It shows how accustomed we get to relying on familiar presentation styles - 'this is the plan' and 'here are some elevations'. Everyone struggled to convey information about things related to magnitudes, and there was a general lack of clarity on the slides, too much information crammed onto each slide.<br />
The thing that really struck me was that when stripped of the framework imposed on every presentation since first year there was very little to fall back on, the <em>story</em><strong><em> </em></strong>just didn't flow. It is tempting to think of this as a failing of my students (and by extension, myself), but i'd be interested to see a good startup entrepreneur pitching a building design. I'd imagine that a really ace presenter of either ilk could cross over without too much trouble, but mere mortals - less easy!</p>
