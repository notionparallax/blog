<p>I'm subscribed to quite a lot of blogs. It struck me the other day that ones that I'm most attached to have very little to do with my field. Actually, they are specifically aimed at other fields. My top three of these are below, but if you have any suggestions then I'd love to hear them.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.jimseven.com/"><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/webshop_2_large.jpg?100585" alt="" width="200" />Jimseven </a></h2>
<p>James Hoffman's blog is primarily about coffee, but it is about the whole experience of coffee, not just making it, or drinking it, but how to make a business of it, the science of brewing and roasting. It's interesting, because he is able to get his point across clearly and simply, but most of all it is interesting because it is relevant. He is talking about how to think about your relationship with your customers, how to do business when your product differentiates itself on quality and experience, lots of things that are not particularly specific to coffee at all!</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/coding-horror-official-logo-small.png" alt="" width="200" />Coding Horror</a></h2>
<p>This one is kind of related I suppose, but the really interesting posts are about how to deal with people, not about coding specifically. Programmers are just people working on projects, but they have a tendency to process optimise, so that leads to some interesting ideas[^1].</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.alistapart.com"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/being-real-builds-trust.jpg" alt="" width="200" />A List Apart</a></h2>
<p>Ostensibly about creating the web. This is more like a magazine than a blog; it is lots of long(ish) form articles, with illustrations. There is a lot of stuff about how to think about designing a site (but you can substitute anything in there if you don't make sites, you could swap site for building or car just as easily) and plenty of discussion of how _users_ should be considered.</p>

[^1]: I'd love to know if there is a Harvard business school type book about software development concepts and how they relate to other fields. There is always the Christopher Alexander stuff, but I've been thinking about how you could apply test driven design to other types of project, not just software.
