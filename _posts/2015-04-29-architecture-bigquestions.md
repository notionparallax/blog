<p>In 1900 David Hilbert posed a series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems" rel="nofollow">23 problems</a> to the mathematical community.</p>
<p>These 23 questions have given the world of mathematics something to focus on for over a century. Some of the questions are still to be solved. Solving one pretty much guarantees that person a Field’s medal (Equivalent to a Nobel or a Pritzker prize). Architecture doesn’t have a set of key questions. This is a search to find some. A search to find if it’s even possible!</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow at about 4:30pm AEST we're going to start tweeting questions. We'll pull them all together with the hashtags **#architecture** and **#bigquestions.** Then the world can answer the ones that are answerable, and refine the unanswerable ones into that special set.</p>
<p>We'd love for other people to get involved. Just search for those hashtags and have a look at what's already there. Then post some questions of your own. You don't need to be an architect; everyone is affected by architecture so everyone gets to have an opinion and to ask questions.</p>
<p>In 115 years someone else might have the same conversation and start it with "In 2015 the world posed architecture's 23 biggest questions".</p>
