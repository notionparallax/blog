<p>I've been listening to a lot of podcasts lately, and it's been making me think. I've found that drawing diagrams of the core ideas helps me understand the extents of the idea, which are usually wider than I'd expected before drawign the diagram. (see what comes of reading '<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Back-Napkin-Solving-Problems-Pictures/dp/1591841992/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1233607594&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">on the back of a napkin</a>'!)</p>
