<p>i'm feeling quite grown up, i've just go myself my second piece of legal commercial software (third if you include windows)</p>
<p>so now i have legit copies of <a href="http://www.gcuser.com">Generative Components</a> and of <a href="http://ecotect.com/home">Ecotect</a>, one day i might have lots of legal commercial software, but i might go open source for a few things like office.</p>
<p>it's quite a funny feeling after all these years of only having cracked software, but i think that cracked software is still very important. without it i would never have go to the position where i could justify the buying some real software. i really think that companies that charge for student copies of software are shooting themselves in the foot by preventing students getting hooked and thereby making a market once they have graduated.</p>
