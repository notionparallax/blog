<p>I was doing some wireframes last week and I kept running into a problem of not knowing how much space to give to any particular text area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wfFont.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-1493 aligncenter" alt="wfFont" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/wfFont.gif" width="600" height="196" /></a></p>
<p>I solved this by filling up the text areas with some indicative text, but it wasn't particularly well though through, so instead of putting it in and then taking it out, I turned it into junk text. I made two fonts using <a href="http://www.paintfont.com/">paintfont</a>'s generator forms, cleaned them up in <a href="http://fontforge.org/">fontforge </a>and then I just swap the readable one for the meaningless one when I want people to ignore the text and focus on the layout.</p>
<p>It's not a perfect fit, but it does the job to quickly swap real text for scribbles.</p>
<p>Feel free to download these <a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wireframe-fonts.zip">wireframe fonts</a> and have a go yourself.</p>
