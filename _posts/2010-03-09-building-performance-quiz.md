<p><img class="alignright" style="width: 300px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/exampleAnswer.png" alt="example answer image" />Finally it is launched!!</p>
<p>There have been a lot of long nights of faffing about with learning about the technology that runs the internet, But now the _building performance quiz_ is live, working reasonably well in most browsers, and has started producing results!</p>
<p>So "what is it?" I hear you ask!</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons that I can't tell you everything about it just yet. But for now it is a quiz that shows up what you know and don't know about designing for building performance within the emerging low carbon economy.</p>
<p>The key thing is that a lot of people have a go at the quiz, so if you have a screen, and some time, then please do it, and if you have all of the above, and friends, then send it to all of them and beg them to do it too. Please!!!</p>
<p>have a go!</p>
