<p>I got a bit sleepy in a meeting the other day and I started drawing. It was one of those darkened room affairs with an impeding food coma, so i needed something to ease the pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It just so happened that I was drawing with my Livescribe pen. I'm going to post this now, but I'll finish it off later. <img style="float:right;" title="ohNoesPho" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ohNoesPho.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="302" /></p>
<p>Here's a photo of the pen scribble in my book. It's about 50mm across in real life.</p>
<p>The finished version is missing a lot of the feinter lines as the pressure sensor on the pen isn't as responsive as something like a good wacom tablet.</p>
