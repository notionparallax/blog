<p>I'm starting to find that teaching is actually really hard. I think that when I started that I was just terrified that I'd run out of stuff to say, or that I'd look like an idiot. I remember the panic when my first hour long lecture, which i was convinced would over run ended after 35 minutes.</p>
<p>I'm much calmer now these days, but begin in the situation where I'm  teaching, and being taught at the same academic level is still a very strange situation to be in.</p>
<p>The main struggle I have now is about the nuances of teaching, I feel that I'm got to the point now where I can see that there is a huge amount of stuff I don't know. Not so much about the subject, but more about the best way to engage other people, and make them think that the thing that I thought was worth learning about enough to get to this level is exciting enough to want to learn it too.</p>

<p> I suppose that is the difference between teaching and just spouting information is the same one that they argue endlessly about in white men can't jump.</p>

<p>The bit of air between my mouth and the student's ears is where the information gets lost, and that's just the start of the difficulties! I can't possibly teach all the stuff that they need to know, so how do I inspire/threaten them into doing the extra work needed?</p>
<p>One of the big problems I have is structuring my time in the alloted 3 hours. Teaching GC is very complicated, and there are a few different things that people need to be able to understand in order to understand the basics. This means that there will always be a fair bit of very specific personal time needed, but that eats into the time that I can spend being 'inspirational' and doing the grand stuff like teaching a new approach to something.</p>
<p>If I teach this next semester, I think that a much more structured approach is needed,  a more fundamental grounding, spending a bit longer gettign everone up to speed, rather than giving them the high speed 'get going in a flash' teaching that I am accustomed to from a workshop basis. Also i think that I need to be a bit more dictatorial, and less Stiener, less asking peopel what they want to learn and more predetermined deadlines. That might be tricky, it's not very me.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things that i'm sure i'll be away more eloquant about when it's not 2am.</p>
