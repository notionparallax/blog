<p>I'm feeling a bit virtuous at the moment, I've just fixed my digital thermometer after I burned through the cable in a fit of retardedness.<br />
I haven't checked that it still gives the right temperature, but it looks about right.<br />
If anyone's interested, it's a<a href="http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/20103016"> digital thermometer from Ikea</a>, and it costs about a fiver, perfect for roasting meat, or checking the temperature of the water you pour onto your coffee. (yes I do that, what a gimp)<br />
