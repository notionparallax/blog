<p>What is the UK carbon abatement (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reductions) target for 2050? (As a percentage of 1990 emissions.)</p>
<ol>
<li>80</li>
<li>40</li>
<li>60</li>
<li>90</li>
</ol>
<p>The Climate Change Act 2008 sets legally binding emission reduction targets for 2020 (reduction of 34 percent in greenhouse gas emissions) and for 2050 (reduction of at least 80 percent in greenhouse gas emissions and introduces five-yearly carbon budgets to help ensure those targets are met.</p>

<p>How fast are isotherms (lines of equal temperature around the globe) currently moving poleward?</p>
<ol>
<li>40km a decade</li>
<li>60km a decade</li>
<li>10km a decade</li>
<li>30km a decade</li>
</ol>
<p>Average isotherm migration rate is about 40 km per decade. The average rate of poleward migration of plant and animal species is about 6km per decade. This means that species’ comfortable climate zones are moving far faster than they can keep up with.</p>

<p>Global Warming Potential is a measurement that compares the radiative forcing of a given gas to CO<sub>2</sub>. When measured over 100 years, Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) has a value of 25. i.e. 25 times more potent.</p>

<p>How many square metres of crystalline photo voltaic cells would power a normal house on a sunny day?</p>
<ol>
<li>3m₂</li>

<li>10m₂</li>
<li>20m₂</li>
</ol>
<p>Current crystalline PV panels provide about 60 to 200 watts an hour per m₂ (at peak output). A house generally draws about 350 watts per hour on average. So it would take roughly 3 m₂ of PV panels to run the house.</p>

<li>about 1500</li>
<li>about 500</li>
<li>about 100</li>
<li>about 800</li>

<p>1 megawatt will power about 300 homes, so a 5 megawatt turbine will be enough for about 1500 homes. That means that 50 of them would comfortably power a town about the size of Oxford.</p>

<p>Albedo is a measurement of the rate of what?</p>
<ol>
<li>Heat reflection into the atmosphere</li>
<li>Oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> absorption</li>
<li>Extinction of mammals</li>
<li>Algae reproduction</li>
</ol>
<p>Albedo is the rate at which heat is reflected back into the atmosphere. A high albedo happens with light colours for example grass, whilst a low albedo occurs with dark colours such as tarmac.</p>
<p>Read the Wikipedia article about albedo</p>

<p>In what sort of climate is it ideal to have large amounts of exposed thermal mass?</p>
<ol>
<li>Deserts (large temperature differences)</li>
<li>Tropical Climates (small temperature differences)</li>
<li>Cold Climates (small temperature differences)</li>
<li>Cities (small temperature differences)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thermal mass is particularly important in the design of buildings in environments with a high diurnal range. In some deserts, for example, the daytime temperature can reach well over 40 degrees. The following night, however, temperatures can fall to below freezing. If materials with a thermal lag of 10-12 hours are carefully used, then the low night-time temperatures will reach the internal surfaces around the middle of the day, cooling the inside air down. Similarly, the high daytime temperatures will reach the internal surfaces late in the evening, heating the inside up.<br />
In climates that are constantly hot or constantly cold, the thermal mass effect can actually be detrimental. This is because both surfaces will tend towards the average daily temperature which, if it is above or below the comfortable range, will result in even more occupant discomfort due to unwanted mean radiant gains or losses. Thus in warm tropical and equatorial climates, buildings tend to be very open and lightweight. In very cold and sub-polar regions, buildings are usually highly insulated with very little exposed thermal mass, even if it is used for structural reasons.</p>

<p>Using one joule of energy in one second is how many watts?</p>
<ol>
<li>1</li>
<li>10</li>
<li>0.1</li>
<li>100</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving 1 Newton 1 metre uses 1 joule. This is about equivalent to moving an apple from the floor to a table. Using 1 joule in 1 second is 1 watt. So running a 100 watt light bulb uses enough power to move 100 apples 1 metre every second. (In an ideal world with no friction, and with a perfect machine...)</p>
<p>Saul Griffith does a great job of explaining what a watt actually _is_ in his talk about Energy Literacy</p>

<p>What Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band is the average UK house?</p>
<ol>
<li>D</li>
<li>A</li>
<li>F</li>
<li>B</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the Energy Performance Certificate’s (EPC) energy efficiency rating bands, two out of five homes in England and Wales (44 per cent) rate ‘average’ for energy efficiency falling into band D, whilst only a tiny proportion (1 per cent) of homes achieve the highest ranking of band A or B.</p>

<p>What is a Trombe wall for?</p>
<ol>
<li>Passive thermal heating</li>
<li>Passive thermal cooling</li>
<li>Diffusing direct light</li>
<li>Structural Reasons</li>
</ol>
<p>A Trombe wall is a dark coloured masonry or concrete wall covered externally with a glass skin spaced in front to leave a small air space. Solar radiation passes through the glass and is absorbed by the mass wall. The mass is heated during the day and then releases its warmth to the interior during the evening and night hours. Ideally the glazing should have exterior insulating shutters for night-time use in order to prevent the heat gained from being returned back to the outside. Vents can also be placed in the wall to make use of convection currents to directly heat the room behind during the day.</p>

<p>The Met is a measurement of metabolic rate. Assuming that you are sitting fairly still at your computer, how many Mets are you generating at the moment?</p>
<ol>
<li>1</li>
<li>8</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>0.8</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally, metabolism is measured in Met (1MET = 58 W/m₂ of body surface). A normal adult has a surface of 1.7 m₂, and a person in thermal comfort with an activity level of 1 Met will thus have a heat loss of approximately 100 W.</p>

<p>The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (formerly known as the Carbon Reduction Commitment) is the UK’s mandatory climate change and energy saving scheme, due to start in April 2010. It is central to the UK’s strategy for improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. It has been designed to raise awareness in large organisations, especially at senior level, and encourage changes in behaviour and infrastructure. The schemes amended title serves to better reflect the CRC’s focus on increasing energy efficiency.</p>

<ol>
<li>Predicted Mean Vote</li>
<li>Personal Meal Value</li>
<li>Principle Material Valency</li>
<li>Passy-Muir Valve</li>
</ol>
<p>The Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) refers to a thermal scale that runs from Cold (-3) to Hot (+3 originally developed by Fanger and later adopted as an ISO standard. The original data was collected by subjecting a large number of people (reputedly many thousands of Israeli soldiers) to different conditions within a climate chamber and having them select a position on the scale the best described their comfort sensation. A mathematical model of the relationship between all the environmental and physiological factors considered was then derived from the data. It wasn’t actually as simple as that, as the fundamentals of the equation are actually based on a physical analysis of the thermal exchanges and then modified slightly to fit the data, however it’s a fair summary</p>

<p>Where does the most heat escape in an average home?</p>
<ol>
<li>Through the walls</li>
<li>Through the floor</li>
<li>Through the windows</li>
<li>Through the roof</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the Centre for Alternative Technology’s _Energy Efficiency in the Home_ fact sheet, 35% of the heat lost from an average home is through the walls.<br />
If you have cavity walls you can easily get insulation blown in. This takes less than a day to do and causes minimum disruption. It is a little more expensive and disruptive to insulate solid walls, but still worthwhile. Internal insulation can be put up on the inside of external walls. You lose a little of the room space and will need to re-plaster, but you will save on energy from heating. External insulation is less disruptive, and it means you keep the ‘thermal mass’ of wall inside. The wall will then act as a form of heat storage, absorbing heat and slowly releasing it &amp;#150; so making a comfortable living environment.</p>
