<p>There's been some discussion about the correct way to write numbers today at work. Here's my take on it:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1384" alt="thousandSeparators" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/thousandSeparators.png" /></p>
<p>And with the hidden chars turned on:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1386" alt="thousandSeparatorsWhidden" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/thousandSeparatorsWhidden.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve always been surprised that people still use a comma to separate thousands as they’ve been deprecated since the ’70s!</p>
<blockquote cite="http://extranet.edfac.unimelb.edu.au/DSME/decimals/SLIMversion/backinfo/overseas.shtml"><p>In different countries around the world, different symbols are used to mark the decimal part of the number and to separate the thousands. In Australia today we use a decimal point and a space (as a thousands separator), but until the 1970′s the accepted notation was a comma as a thousands separator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We ran into this on a competition we did a while ago, and it turns out that the correct thousand separator is a thin space.</p>
<p> It’s <code>&amp;thinsp;</code> in html and in InDesign you can get to it with the shortcut** [ctrl]+[shift]+[alt]+[m]** or through the _Type → Insert white space → Thin space_ menu.</p>
