<p>right, I've been awake for 20 hours now, and i'm showing no signs of slowing down, a double hit of <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18925391.300" title="mmm, go pills!">modafinil</a> at 5:30 today showed it's usual 16 hour hill, but thanks to a big sugary hit of hot chocolate hit, i'm bouncing like loon to <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net/solidsteel/" title="DK and Food get funky!">solid steel radio</a> (the savior of my sanity during my third year of degree, but foolishly forgotten)</p>
<p>My trip to RMIT is all on now, and it all hinges about gettign the correct forms filled in and sent to the right people, but with very little guidance, and an 11 hour time difference at play it's tricky, I should be going some time in January, and the couple of weeks to get my head around the city, and all the prime coffee.</p>
<p>I was teaching a UEL again today, this time I wasn't <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=51069&amp;l=24e37&amp;id=541400612">Josh's</a> little bitch, preping his students for his full on assault while he parties at weddings in LA, it was my show, and despite the usual pre-terror, it all came together (i think).Â  We bashed into a bit of LUA scripting for ecotect, and the scripts we covered are living on the <a href="http://wiki.uelceca.net/20072008/published/Ecotect+code" title="well, it should be anyway...">ceca wiki</a> now.</p>
<p>Given that the termÂ  doesn't start at RMIT until the 3rd of March, i've finally got a chance to get all the litte bits tied up that i've had on my task list for years and years. all the little stuff, like doing the image credits on my degree dissertation, and designing my dad's house that i really ought to have done ages ago, but have been dragging my heels. I've also gotÂ  an absolutely massive pile of books that i've been buying from amazon and then not finishing to much through.</p>
<p>so it's all about trying to resolve my work life balance to the point where there is much more life involves from now on!</p>
