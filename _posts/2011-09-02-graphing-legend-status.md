<p>I've just finished doing a 31 day challenge of doing 31 <a title="At the Darlinghurst studio" href="http://bikramyoga.net.au/Home.htm">Bikram yoga</a> classes in August. It was pretty hard going, especially about 3/4 of the way through when I was just feeling tired all the time, but in the last week it seemed to get a lot easier as I could feel it coming to an end. I liked the arbitrary nature of the challenge, no good reason for doing it other than because it was there.</p>

<p>I got a nice little certificate with a gold star (the first gold star that I've got since I was about 7 I think), and a feeling of "Ah, no need to go to yoga tomorrow!". The certificate claims that I'm now a "total legend", yay! I tracked what I was eating and how much work I was doing on Daily Burn, and it was pretty fun watching the graph. (The spiky bit at the end is me doing doubles every other day for a week.) I'm pretty sceptical of the accuracy, but the trends were useful. There was something really motivating about watching the graph, and I think that it might well be a generally useful thing to do.</p>
<p>Which Leads me to my next arbitrary challenge. I'm going to ease off the yoga this month, and work on my maths with the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan academy</a>.</p>

<p>I'll pick some other random target next month, or maybe even sooner.</p>
<p>Other than sore shoulders, doing that much yoga has left me feeling pretty positive in general; oddly not in a "woo isn't everything awesome" kind of way. but in a "shit happens" kind of way. Upon accepting that shit happens I can now work on letting the bad shit fly past me, and hold on tight to the good shit. My memory is pretty terrible so I'm going to try and fill it with maths and good memories, there isn't space for the bad ones.</p>
