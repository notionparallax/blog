<p>While GCuser is down, I thought I'd be kind to the world and post my tutorials on here for the wold to see.</p>
<p>I've revamped and re-energised the two main tutorials. There are still appearances from <a href="http://www.pauldaniels.co.uk" target="_blank">Paul Daniels and Debbie Magee</a>, <a href="http://www.vanillaice.com/" title="Robert Matthew Van Winkle (born October 31, 1967)">Vanilla ice</a>, and there is a special guest appearance from Snow White's step mother - none other than the evil queen herself!!!</p>
<p>I'll post more stuff as it gets 'finished' but in the meantime, if you find any problems with these two, let me know via the comments.</p>

<p>and for the keenies out there, here's <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpressImages/GC_tutes/September_08_GC_tutorial_package.zip">everything</a>...</p>
<p>it's 19mb, so if my server has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Freak">freak out</a>, then I'll have to kill it, so get in while it's hot!!</p>
