<p>Here are the slides from my talk at UTS last Thursday at the generative components university program show case, about genetic algorithms. The slides don't make a huge amount of sense on their own, but if you were there, it might jog your memory. </p>
<p>The talk was filmed, and I’ve been promised that it'll show up on Google video at some point in the future if you want to see what I have to say about blind darts playing pirates and their relevance to heuristic algorithms.</p>

There really should be an iframe here :(

<p>Acrobat butchered some of the text when I exported, but otherwise it’s all fine. There are 2 live demos that aren’t in there, but they’ll show up in the video and I’ll publish the code soon.</p>
