<p>The videos from the Smart Geometry conference and alumni day are finally up. <a href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Promo/SmartGeometry/2009/Conference.htm">Look here for them</a>, you might need to log in, which is a drag, but just make up a name</p>
<p>There is the chance to see really interesting talks from the likes of Josh Mason, Judit Kimpian &amp; Jeroen Coenders (spooky J<sup>3</sup> thing there) talking about using a model of generic towers to get very quick design space exploration, and a talk from Jim McBride of Makani Power Inc.  </p>
<p>You also get the pleasure of seeing me presenting the visualising complexity group, there was some good stuff in there and I fear that my rabbit in the headlights/paralysing hangover stylings weren't doing them justice.</p>
<p>It'll be good to see how these projects pan out in the end, if you are one of the people I presented then let me know how it's going in the comments.</p>
<p>This doesn't work properly in any browser other than IE (as bentley haven't noticed that it's now a minority browser amongst the geeky types that will be watching these videos) so the slides won't update automatically, might be time to brush the dust off that old IE for a few minutes.</p>
