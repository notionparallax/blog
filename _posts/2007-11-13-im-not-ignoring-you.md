<p>If anyone tries calling me in the next few days, there is only a very tiny chance that I will pick up.</p>

<p>I've cracked the screen on my phone, and as it was in silent mode when it happened, the only way I can tell if someone is calling is by the screen flashing.</p>
<p>It's a pretty good indicator of my current mental state that when i first saw it, I thought that I'd been sent a really beautiful picture of a leaf.</p>
