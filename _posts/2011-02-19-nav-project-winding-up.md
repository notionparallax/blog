<p>The navigation project that Dan &amp; Bin have been working on over the summer is about to finish. We've got one week left, so it's mostly commenting and tidying up.</p>
<p>It's a long way from being a commercial product, but it is certainly useful as an in-house tool. There will be more on the blog about where we are now, and where we could go from here, in the next week, but just as a reminder - here's the link <a href="http://blog.bvn-usyd.com/">blog.bvn-usyd.com</a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty impressive in action, it finds the shortest path (or top n shortest paths) in a cellular building, and can display the measurement along the path. It can do lots of other stuff too, but I'll leave that up to the boys to describe!</p>
