<p>While tidying up yesterday I realised that my bag contents was getting pretty close to a stable ideal that I'm happy with. Here's what and why: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.bogear.com.au/cellblock-m">Red Cellblock M</a></h4>
<p>I realised that most of what I carry is roughly A5. I was on the lookout for a little A5 pouch. My friend Ross bought one of BO gear's Bullpup backpacks a while ago. He had it shipped to me and I was impressed. Adding the two things together...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1P1K9Jv">Clairefontaine notebook</a></h4>
<p>I got this in France last year. It's thick, has paper that doesn't run [1. I can't stand the paper in a moleskine!] and most of all it's cheap, so I don't feel precious about using it.</li>
<li>
<h4>Kindle</h4>
<p>I now actively dislike reading paper books. The kindle frees the book to become an art form in its own right! Freed from its job of conveying information.<br />
Less penny dreadful, more Lindisfarne gospel! Being able to define words and highlight things in a way that makes them indexable is fantastic. I find myself doing it in paper books now.</li>
<li>
<h4>Printed papers</h4>
<p>The thing I like less than books is reading PDFs on screen. I think that publishing a PDF is a clear slap in the face for your readership. However, the printer at work prints these lovely little books so I can make the best of a bad situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Muji pen case</h4>
<p>We ran a conference at work called the Futures Forum, in the goodie bag we put in the things that people would need to sketchnote the sessions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Muji highlighter</h4>
<p>More Futures Forum swag. I love the little window that shows you what you are highlighting. Regular highlighers cover up what you need to see.</li>
<li>
<h4>Pilot V point disposable fountain pen - blue and black</h4>
<p>I like writing with a fountain pen. Ideas just seem to come out more easily. I don't trust myself to have a 'nice' pen, but the tips on these are great.</li>
<li>
<h4>Memory stick</h4>
<p>Sometimes you just need to transfer an episode of GOT or something!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.leatherman.com/wingman-831426.html">Leatherman Wingman</a></h4>
<p>I use this quite a lot on long journeys to do my nails. It keeps my occupied.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1SEPBrp">Sunwayman Elfin Torch</a></h4>
<p>This seems like a good idea. It's new so I don't have any cool stories about using it yet.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://eatlikeachief.com/">Chief bar</a></h4>
<p>This is for warding off the hangry.</li>
<li>
<h4>Toothbrush &amp; toothpaste</h4>
<p>For cleaning archaeological finds, and my teeth.</li>
<li>
<h4>Resistance band</h4>
<p>This is for keeping my shoulders healthy. I do passthroughs while I'm standing at my desk.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://www.kogan.com/au/buy/xiaomi-16000mah-mi-power-bank/">Backup battery</a></h4>
<p>I seem to be perpetually out of battery, this is an attempt to fix that.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.optimoz.com.au/collections/all/products/uvex-blue-light-blockers">Uvex Skyper glasses</a></h4>
<p>These make me look like a serial killer, but they make me sleep well, so I'm not too bothered.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.sacredsoundaudio.com/products/infinityone?variant=271791260">Headphones</a></h4>
<p>Nice _and_ cheap, not just cheap. Irina lost one of the ear bits, so now I have one ear that gets some extra ambient noise. I also have a set of massive Sennheiser cans--their main job is to make people leave me alone!</li>
<li>
<h4>Key ring</h4>
<p>The actual ring is from a fancy keyring. It was massive and I coudn't get the whole thing into my pocket. I scrapped the decorative bit and just kept the ring! It lives clipped into my bag now and it's hardly ever not there.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Tile</h4>
<p>Because the keys are always in my bag I can tell where my bag is. I have one in my wallet too.</li>
<li>
<h4>Key</h4>
<p>Just a back door key. I had 4 keys on here until I was laying out this photo and I realised that 3 of them were for my old house!</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1OLXViM">Nite Ize DoohicKey</a></h4>
<p>Er, I guess this is useful, potentially, in the future. It's got a nice clippy thing, and it's better than keys at opening boxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Not pictured</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.memobottle.com/products/a5-memobottle">A5 Memobottle</a></h4>
<p>Given that everything is flat and A5, it makes sense to keep the theme running. I got it from their Kickstarter.</li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_(2013_version)">Nexus 7</a></h4>
<p>I took the photo with it. It's become my main information-consumption device. I almost always have it with me, which is more than I can say for my phone.</li>
<li>
<h4><a>Black Diamond Hollowpoint</a></h4>
<p>It's light, it's got barely any features, and what it does have is really well thought out. When I had a bag with lots of pockets I would lose things. This is like an acorn collecting sack: one big hole in the top, that's it!</li>
