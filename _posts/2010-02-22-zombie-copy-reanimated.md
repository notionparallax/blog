<p><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zombiecopy/"><img class="alignright" title="Zombie Copy" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/proofers_tools.jpg" alt="Axe writer" width="260" height="405" /></a>Take a look at this article: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/zombiecopy/">Zombie Copy</a>.</p>
<p>It is could have been written specifically for architects!</p>
<p>I particularly like the transformation of...</p>
<blockquote><p>Every executive knows that constantly delivering superior customer value is an imperative to veritably creating shareholder value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>into...</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to make lots of money, you have to please your customers more than the other guy does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I suppose that the moral of the story is that; amongst the people who _look_ at your work there are always going to be a few smart people out there that can _read_,  they'll notice if you use a thesaurus liberally throughout your writing. So save yourself the ridicule later, and write down what you actually mean, it'll be quicker, and it might actually be interesting!</p>
