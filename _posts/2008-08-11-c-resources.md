<p>People are always looking to get a bit of a jump on this GC programming stuff.</p>
<p>GC script is a cut down version of C#, so if you can write C# then you'll be laughing, especially as in a while you'll probably want to  write external plugins for GC that live out in C# land!</p>
<p>There are a few places to look.</p>
<p>The old Microsoft videos are  a bit hidden now, and could disappear at any time, so download them for your home viewing pleasure. They live here - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-au/beginner/bb308760.aspx" target="_blank">Beginner Developer Learning Center</a>. The bits &amp; bytes ones are good, and the tier , lessons 4, 5 &amp; 6 are a good start (the rest are C# specific, but really won't hurt you!)</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bb308898.CsharpForKids(en-us).png" align="left" width="100" />The C# for sharp kids book is really good, and really well supported. It's written for kids, so it's at about the right level for architects.</p>
<p>For just a general intro to programming the best book in the world is why's poignant guide to ruby,Â  it's so beautiful it will make you cry.</p>
