<p>I've started teaching a design studio (believe it or not)!</p>
<p>As is usually the way with things that I do, it's going to be pretty experimental. Here are some of the links to what they are up to:</p>
<p><a href="http://beginnersguidetotheapocalypse.wikispaces.com/">http://beginnersguidetotheapocalypse.wikispaces.com/</a> is a simple 'messy space' wiki for them to share things.</p>
<p><a href="http://utsapocalypse.net/">http://utsapocalypse.net/</a> is a place for them to blog <em>daily </em>in a slightly more formal way.</p>
<p>and this <a title="The brief, as it stands" href="http://bit.ly/dZIeNC">http://bit.ly/dZIeNC</a> is the brief that I've given them at the moment.</p>
<p>I'll keep updating things as they happen, so keep going back, especially to the blogs, if there are 15 people posting once a day then we ought to have over a thousand blog posts by the end of the semester!</p>
