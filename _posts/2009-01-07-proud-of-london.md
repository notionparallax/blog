<p>The more of the world I see, the more impressed I am with the london system of transport, public and otherwise.</p>

<p>Dear Mr Doherty, </p>
<p>Motorcycles can now travel on most Red Route bus lanes across London for an 18 month trial ending 4 July 2010. Please visit <a href="http://www.c-f-1.com/d.aspx?e=MTUzODIzMTk0NQ==&amp;c=1&amp;linkID=1086390" target="_blank" title="This external link will open in a new window" style="color: #003399">tfl.gov.uk/motorcyclesinbuslanes</a> for more information. New signage has been installed on all relevant routes to show which bus lanes motorcycles are allowed to travel on. Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>This will probably have mixed reviews from the cyclists but, as one of them, I'm in favour. I've never had a problem with motorbikes, and anything to encourage people out of their metal coffins has got to be good!</p>
