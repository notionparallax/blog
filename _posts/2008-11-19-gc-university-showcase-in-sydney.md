<p>The culmination of this semester's hard work from all the students that have been involved in the current incarnation of the Generative Components university program will be at UTS on the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of this month (November)So far it's shaping up to be a fascinating 2 days, mainly because unlike last time, I won't be the main presenter!!</p>
<p>We've got a great lineup of speakers from <a href="http://www.labarchitecture.com/" title="Sam Kassuk">LAB</a>, <a href="http://www.arup.com/australasia/" title="Steve Downing, Matt Vola, John Legge-Wilkinson">Arup</a>, <a href="http://www.woodsbagot.com/en/Pages/default.aspx" title="Ben Coorey, David Marchant">Woods Baggot</a>, <a href="http://web.arch.usyd.edu.au/~marcaurel/" title="Marc-Aurel Schnable">University of Sydney</a> and a few others TBC.The first day will be presentations of the work that the five universities have produced this semester (nearly all of it very very impressive, and I'm grumpy cynical these days). So that's work from UTS, QUT, university of Queensland, university of Melbourne and Auckland university. </p>
<p>The second day will be  split up a bit more. The morning will be 2 parallel streams, I'll be running a more advanced workshop where the focus will be on working in teams and very quicky taking bits of the pool of work that the individual team members have produced over the semester, and mashing them together and making a new project.</p>
<p>The other stream will be a bit more of a gentlemen's club type affair where the tutors from each university get together and pick over the good and bad bits of the program, and work out ways to improve it next semester.</p>
<p>The afternoon will be a chance to kick back and see how the 'pros' do it, and then for the 'refreshments'.</p>
<p>If you are a student, come along because it's a great chance to meet the people that you'll run into again and again for the rest of your career, get a huge chunk of inspiration, and show off your wares (it's got serious job getting potential!!).</p>
<p>If you are a 'real person' then come along, there is a massive pool of enthusiasm and talent that is just overflowing with possibilities to enrich your company! There is also a world of  inspiration and new techniques for you to take a critical look at.</p>
