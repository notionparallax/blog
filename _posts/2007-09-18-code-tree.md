I know I bang on about this collaborative working stuff all the time, but code tree is a great example of some people who are into the same sort of stuff just getting on with it and doing something.</p>
<p>There is something quite 80's hacker about the way that they are all just throwing down and trying to better the last guy, but there is no secrecy and bitchy one-upmanship, all the code is shared, so it's a great place to learn some stuff.</p>
<p>check it out, there is some beautiful work up there already, and it's only been going about 1 minute!</p>
