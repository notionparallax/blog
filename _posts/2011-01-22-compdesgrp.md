<p>I knew there was something else that I'd been working on, but I forgot to put it into the <a href="https://notionparallax.co.uk/2011/im-back-ill-try-not-to-go-away-again/">first post back</a>. It is basically a rip off of the <a href="http://www.design-computing.com">London design computing community</a>. It's a meeting every 6 weeks or so to talk about what people have been up to, and what problems they've been running into. The talks are really short, with a lot of emphasis on discussion.</p>

<p>We've had 3 sessions in Sydney, 1 inÂ Melbourne and 1 in Auckland - with another one in each coming up in the very near future. I've been trying to film some of the sessions, so once I get around to doing the video editing I'll post them all on the site.</p>
