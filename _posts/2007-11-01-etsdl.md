<p>Go Kawakita is doing a masters at Brookes as a part of their <a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/schools/be/architecture/postgraduate/eesb/index.html" target="_blank">MSc in Energy Efficient and Sustainable Building</a> program, and as his thesis subject is so similar to mine, I'm tutoring him a bit.</p>
<p>He's going to be prolifically blogging about what he's doing on his <a href="http://www.etsdl.blogspot.com/">blog, ETSDL</a>.</p>
<p>Keep coming back, as it should be interesting! (Hopefully he'll make it look a bit nicer soon though!)</p>
