<p>I've been ranting about humility <a title="Major study – for those with a lot of patience" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/01/major-study-for-those-with-a-lot-of-patience/">for a while</a>. Whilst I still think that it is too rare; I have been seeing a few examples of it. I thought that it might be worth making a place to store them.</p>
<p>Each top-level comment will be a link to an article, and a quick description of its contents; everything else will thread off those top-level comments.</p>
