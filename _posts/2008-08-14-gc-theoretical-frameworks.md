<p>There is a  new bit at the start of the 2 day workshop that I do that deals with a lot of the general theory of using GC, it's still got a long way to go before it's perfect, but it's currently lopping about half a day off the time taken to get to the end of what was previously the end of the workshop.you can find the PDF presentation <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/GC/GC%20theoretical%20framework.pdf" target="_blank">here...</a></p>
<p>..and you can find the scans of the notebook that I planned it in below. I think these 3 pages are actually far more interesting than the finished product!<br />
