<p>In the dying months of my Major Study I pretty much stopped posting. I blame too much time alone in my shed!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.bvn-usyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/micuGraph.png"><img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/micuGraph-229x300.png" alt="" width="229" height="300" /></a>As you might imagine, in 8 months quite a lot has happened, and I've had quite a lot of thoughts that need to be written down and explored. I'm going to make an effort to get some of them down here over the next few weeks. I'm now living in Sydney, working for BVN Architecture as their computational designer, although I have a wonderful amount of freedom to define what that actually means. I've been blogging some of the projects internally and I'll try and get some of them publicly visible as soon as I can. In the meantime here's a project that I've been working on with two computer scientists at the University of Sydney: <a href="http://blog.bvn-usyd.com/">http://blog.bvn-usyd.com/</a> . It has some pretty heavy duty posts in there, but even if you just look at the pictures you might well learn something! (I certainly am!)</p>
