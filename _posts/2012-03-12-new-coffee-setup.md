<p>A long time ago I posted my<a title="coffee making" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2009/10/coffee-making/"> coffee making setup</a>, I was pretty pleased with it at the time, and I still think that it is about the best I'll ever get. That said, a full sized grinder is a bit of a chore to cart around the world, so I've finally rebuilt a setup for using here in&nbsp;Australia. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=569721336">Dan's&nbsp;</a>babysitting&nbsp;my big grinder and I've tightened things up in general; downsizing so that I can get it all on my desk without adding to the general feeling that I'm a freak that there is at work.</p>

<p>To nerdily categorise it all:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="from amazon" href="http://goo.gl/glIUv">Bodum columbia plunger</a></li>
<li>Scales from K Mart</li>
<li>Handmade cup from <a title="The potter here makes great coffee and hot chocolate - and is completely invisible on the internet" href="http://g.co/maps/fae6m">La Lied in Pai</a></li>
<li>Coffee from <a title="Sidikalang Sumatra - Wahana Estate" href="http://www.singleorigin.com.au/">Single Origin</a></li>
<li><a title="Bought at Proud Mary in Melbourne" href="http://goo.gl/6BqW1">Hario slim hand grinder</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I could do with resurrecting the thermometer & timer, and getting those graphs of going.</p>
