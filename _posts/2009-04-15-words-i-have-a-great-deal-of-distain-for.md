<p>I don't want to bang on about this too much today, as I've got a much more spectacular tirade planned, but I wanted to single out these two words for a particular savaging.when I hear otherwise intelligent people use these words, it makes me sad and angry. Sad that they have been sucked into the collective delusion that they are good words to use, and angry that nobody has the courage to stand up and say '_Stop! these words make you sound like an idiot._'</p>
<h2>Materiality</h2>
<p>Materiality is the chief offender of a group of words that end in -iality. You can take any word, and add -iality to it, wordiality, dooriality, spatiality, doggiality.The phrase that really makes my blood boil is often uttered in crits accompanied by copious beard stroking -</p>
<blockquote><p>**"_have you considered materiality_"**</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this really means is '_what is it made of?_" or "_what are the properties of this material that make it particularly appropriate for this situation?_", or any number of other similar questions related to materials, and the offending, beard stroker will counter, '_but every profession has it's lexicon, it merely allows me to convey my meaning in a succinct and crisp way_', with a subtext of '_you clearly don't understand, and you are beneath me_'. My rebuttal to this I'm afraid is a DH0 disagreement, "_**bollocks!**_" but when pressed further I'll try and rise up the disagreement hierarchy and give a more complete answer.Other fields use their specific language to sharpen their enquiry. Paramedics can recount the treatment given and condition of a patient being brought into A&amp;E precisely because their words are so accurate that they need very few of them to completely describe the situation.Our field does exactly the opposite. My main gripe with the "_have you considered materiality_" probe, other than that it infects young impressionable minds with the idea that it's ok to ask that question, is that it's **lazy**, that's it, just plain lazy. The M question (as it shall henceforth be known so that my blood remains at a gentle simmer) allows the questioner the luxury of not really having to ask a question. It is really the equivalent of a raised eyebrow that a nervous student takes to be a indication that they ought to keep talking. Its rise to ubiquity seems to stem from the the questioner not really knowing what the right question ought to be.If you find yourself about to ask the M question in the future, **stop**, for the sake of cute puppies and fairys everywhere don't do it. Instead, ask yourself what is it that I really want to know and ask that question.When presented with a beautiful white card model of a - well, an anything really - the M question is a very easy trap to fall into. But really we can add so much richness to the discussion by simply asking _real_ questions.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is it _made_ of?What do you want it to _feel_ like when you run your hand or your cheek along it?_How_ is it made?What do you want the materials to _say_ about the space?</p>

<h2>Architectonic</h2>
<p>This is a word even more shrouded in obfustication and cigar smoke than materiality but thankfully less commonly used.The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectonic">wikipedia article for architectonic</a> is pitiful, and this seems to reflect the general understanding of the term.From a quick survey of about 15 eloquent, educated architects, the general consensus was that architectonic was about the fact that architecture is made of _pieces of stuff_, and so the -tectonic bit was about the bits of stuff meeting each other and how they did that. However, it was also agreed that it was a frown, nod and stroke beard moment in any conversation where they pretended to know what was being said.Again I'm going to apply the charge of laziness to this one, but on additional charge of laziness of misapropriating words from philosophy without understanding their context.—I've been feeling very alienated by my distaste for these words, but recently I've found an underground movement of people just like me, so I'm making a stand.So next time someone asks you the M question, look them squarely in the eye, and ask them straight back</p>
<blockquote><p>"what, _exactly_, do you mean by that?"</p>
