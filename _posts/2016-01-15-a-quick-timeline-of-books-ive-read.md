<p>I've often wondered about how much data is harvested while I read a Kindle book. It seems like a lot goes to Amazon and the authors, but I couldn't find much for myself.</p>
<p>I've made this timeline by scraping the <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/your_highlights">Kindle notes and hightlights</a> page, then doing a little bit of sublime/spreadsheet fu.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>It only gives date of last highlight, not of the date finished and started, so I've assumed that each book took me about a month to read</li>
<li>It won't show books where I didn't highlight anything. That might account for the reduced amount of reading when I first got a kindle.</li>
<li>I haven't finished all of the books. I've finished most of them but there are a few that are still going, or that I abandoned.</li>
<li>The books aren't classified at all. It'd be good to see how I treat different types of books. E.g. I know I usually finish fiction books in a day or two, but non fiction I drag out a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone can think of a better way to get at this data I'm all ears!</p>

There really should be an iframe here :(
