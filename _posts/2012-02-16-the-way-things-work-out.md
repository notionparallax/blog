I did a bit of ordinary drawing, and a funny little project that was supposedly a pitch for an Apple store (The first in Australia at the time).</p>
<p>It was done in GC, and had a really cool little cascading dependency of intersecting planes to create a shape that was made entirely of planar quads. The last I saw of it was a tracing paper model that I'd pinned to the boss's monitor with a video playing behind it to simulate a busy shopping centre. it looked pretty cool, like a big uncut agate sticking out of the side of the building. As there was a desire to make it as transparent as possible, we did a load of studies into the surface articulation, if I can find them I'll put them here, there were some rally nice pleated versions with dark glass facing the sky and low iron glass facing the ground to make it really transparent. All in all it was pretty delicate and cool.</p>
<p>Quite recently I was in Melbourne again, I had Lunch with <a title="Jess's old site, but I think " href="http://metamiscellanea.wordpress.com/">Jess</a> and afterwards she took me to see something, which turned out to be that window. I had no idea that they'd even proposed it, let alone built it! Unfortunately it's not the most delicate of pieces of construction. It was supposed to have internal structure, and the glass made the skin, but it now looks like a heavy galvanised metal thing with a little bit of glass. Knowing nothing about how it was built, it would be rash of me to be to grumpy about this, but it is a bit of a shame that it isn't as elegant as it could be.</p>
