<p>I saw a certain something in this image, and having showed several other people, without pre-priming them they saw it too.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's stupid marketing people not noticing these things, or incredibly smart marketing, putting in subtle pointers to catch the interest of the dirty minded consumer?</p>
<p>Either way,  a product called 'clitz' isn't going to get into my kitchen any time soon.</p>
