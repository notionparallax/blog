<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/414MNH8VQ1L._SL500_AA240_.jpg" align="right" height="240" width="240" />itunes and napster and the Amazon mp3 shop are all very well if you want to get the new Linkin Park album, or a Norah Jones best of, but it seems that whenever I want a specific song, it's pretty much impossible to get.When I was looking for Q Lazarus, 'goodbye horses', itunes was intent on giving me 'Crazy Horses', and in the end I found it on some wierdo website that just had a free copy.I've been looking for the Ray Charles version of "(come to me) my melancholy baby" for about 2 years now, and short of buying the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pure-Genius-Complete-Recordings-1952-1960/dp/tracks/B000A7KL7U/ref=dp_tracks_all_full#disc_1" target="_blank">£100 boxed set of everything he's ever done</a> (which if you are looking for a Christmas present idea...) I have no idea where to get it.It's a bit of a twisted story, there is a Herbalizer track that samples Marilyn Monroe from 'Some like it hot' saying “I don't what it is but they just curdle me, all they have to do is play eight bars of "Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby" and my spine turns to custard ” so I went on a mission to find out what that was all about, and the 30 second preview of the Ray Charles version makes me “goose pimply all over.Any ideas? </p>
