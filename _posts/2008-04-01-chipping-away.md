<p>finally I seem to have hacked my way around to getting some lines, now all I need is to track and differentiate the points that pop up so that i get beautiful data and the world falls at my feet weeping with joy. (or alternatively, I just don't fail miserably)</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/microstnPencil.jpg" align="left" height="200" />I've worked with one of my students (sham) on updating the old code i did in acad and microstation vba to draw hexagons, so now it'll draw a hexagonal polygon in GC, so hopefully when he's finished commenting that code he'll upload it.</p>
<p>I like it when something works, it makes me feel as if it's not all futile, and reminds me that it'll all be ok in the end!</p>
<p>I need to get my coffee filter into <a href="http://www.sial.rmit.edu.au/" target="_blank">sial</a> so that I can indulge my interest in fine single origin coffee just that little bit more, and see if i can go without sleep on a more permanent basis.</p>
