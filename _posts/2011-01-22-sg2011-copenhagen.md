<p>Applications for <a href="http://www.smartgeometry.org/content/smartgeometry-2011-copenhagen-0">Smart Geometry 2011</a> have opened but are only open for another week. This year has some pretty varied clusters, so head over to their site and have a look.</p>

<p>Smart geometry is an amazing experience, being locked up with 100 really smart people for 4 days can result in some incredible outcomes.</p>
