Ever since I finished my degree dissertation there was a nagging feeling that there were some ends that needed to be tidied up. Not long after, I went on a massive vector crusade and redrew all the non photographic images. That was just after Christmas in 2005, and now it's half way through 2009 â€“ it's taken me 4 years to get around to polishing up the last few bits and re posting it.</p>
<p>Bizzarely enough, even though it isn't directly linked from anywhere on this site, it is still one of the most popular downloads, with one of the main sources coming from somewhere buried deep inside the<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1GGLS_enAU327AU327&ei=RE5CSuyhHpqSjAe785WnBg&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=Ben+Doherty+personal+website+Very+Interesting+article+Do+computer+design+techniques+enhance+or+retard+the+production+of+architectural+design+(5.87Mb).+Featuring+Gehry,+Greg+Lynn,+Design+Group,+Smart+Geometry+Group,+Marcos+Novak.&spell=1 "> rhino wiki</a>. That version has loads of blank pages and over set text, so I've tried to fix that.</p>
<p>What I haven't done anything to is the content. I wrote it in late 2004, and a lot has changed since, the industry has changed, and I've changed immeasurably. Going though the text to weed out the spelling mistakes, I'm amazed at the bold, and often factually incorrect,  statements that I pepper the text with, but it's interesting nonetheless to see what I thought in those days!</p>
<p>You can get the file from<a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/2009_06_24_dissertation.pdf"> here as a print res version</a>, or from<a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/2009_06_24_dissertation%20screen.pdf"> here for screen res</a>.</p>
