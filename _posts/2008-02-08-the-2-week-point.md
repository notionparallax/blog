<p>Ah, lovely long emails, a great way to spend an evening. I've just demolished intersection magazine, $17 of magazine and $8.50's worth of takeaway noodles and I'm a happy boy. I can usually attribute my lack of happiness to not having had sufficiently nice food, which is something that I don't intend to get too far into at the moment. Melbourne is a foodie heaven. Mmm. I had some biodynamic peaches the other day that were probably not as good as sex, but have been filed in the same category for enjoyment, but without any of the complication or too much of the mess!<br />

<p>I've been having a bit of a 'career wobble', but I think that an organic approach to things is much more my style, planning always leads to my downfall. I think my problem is that if I try and look too far head while I'm walking I get lost at a local level. A bit like seeing a mountain, and heading for it, but looking close to you all the time, but keeping the mountain in your head.</p>
<p>There is plenty to look at in Melbourne, there are loads of small indi design shops, and cafes, mouthwateringly orgasmic cafes, nice restaurants, and vintage Holden (ozzy Dodge) cars. They also have a state sponsored street art program, so there is some terrific graffiti about.</p>

My mind has been drifting off recently into strange fantasies. I've been thinking about these big American style cars, and the phrase 'making out on the hood' keeps running through my mind (you must remember that the bit of my mind that I have conscious access to has no control over the rest of the terrible depths of the inside of my skull) and sometimes it's some sort of late teenage snog fest on the bonnet of a car, and sometimes it's Wayne and Garth looking up at the bottom of a jumbo jet, but the idea of a car that's big enough to sit on is cool in my book!</p>
<p>I'm going surfing this weekend, so I'll get to meet some people, and to burn myself in interesting and amusing ways. Knowing my luck I'll get a sharp line on my legs and arms that'll take about 18 months to get off, a bit like when I wore cycling short when I rode to Brighton last summer. (that line has just faded)</p>
<p>Top of my list of things to take is going to be my hammock, regardless of whether I have a bed or not, the mosquito net that is built in will be put to full effect! I look like something from a horror movie, red blotches all over, but I suppose that is only to be expected if I insist on sleeping naked next to an open window.</p>

<p>Photos of the surfing, but hopefully not the insect inflicted mutilation will follow.</p>
