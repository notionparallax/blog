<p>I've decided to stop being so precious about this blog and to just start pouring out my thoughts onto it.</p>
<p>There will be posts about</p>
<p>my ideas for a collaborative, online, 3d, design system,<br />
my dinners,<br />
stuff I'm doing,<br />
how my thesis is progressing<br />
what coffee I'm drinking<br />
loads of other stuff<br />
and a few links to websites and the like. </p>
<p>At the moment I'm trying to drag myself out of a big mental hole caused by a few things, but mainly the fact that since I got my scooter I've been doing absolutely zero exercise.<br />
I went for a run on Tuesday and was super wired for hours afterwards, so I'm going to make a concious effort to do as much exercise as I can.</p>
<p>I'm going climbing outdoors for the first time since i got back from italy (so that's about six years ago!) so i'm pretty excited. google maps seems to want me to take a bit of a funny route though! Maybe it's an easter egg.<br />

<p>I'll try and post some pictures of the goings on on Sunday when i get back.</p>
