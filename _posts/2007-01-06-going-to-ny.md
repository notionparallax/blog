<p >I'm officially going to New York at the end of the month now for the smart geometry workshop and conference thingy.</p>
<p >That means that apart from having to collect order for about a million ipods and things like that, I'm actually going to have to work on my proposed plan a bit too!</p>
<p >It's ultimate aim is to produce a suite of site analysis tools that you can apply to a site model.</p>
<p >I'd like to do something like using the US military spy drones   or the way they did the 'driver' computer game (like  <a title="funny wings" target="_blank" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7903">this</a> or  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/article/dn9328">this</a> or  <a target="_blank" href="http://digitalurban.blogspot.com/2006/03/microsoft-live-local-technology.html">this</a>) that can scan an area of city and then do loads of test on it using agent models and environmental models and that sort of thing. Then you can start designing with loads of information about the site.</p>
<p >I'm not planning to make any new methods, just implement other ones in GC and see if I can make anything work.</p>
<p >The other thing I'm planning on doing is to try and collect the useful stuff that other people are doing and get it all put together on the <a href="http://www.gcuser.com/">GCuser</a> website in the toybox so that there is a foundation of gct files and handy scripts for people to build on, bit for learning and making new stuff.</p>
