<p>So, for those of you who I haven't told (and as I assume that nobody else actually reads this, that's nobody) I'm doing an elective called _meals in metropolis_. It examines urban agriculture and it's implications for cities and a load of other stuff as well.</p>
<p>Of course being me, i haven't read much of the stuff on the reading list, but i have just finished reading this. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Revolution-Will-Not-Be-Microwaved/dp/1933392118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1206658199&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The revolution will not be microwaved</a> is actually pretty good. There is a awful lot of hippy arm waving and associated corporation bashing that harks back to the bad old days of the no logo anti establishment clones, but if you can get past the fact all of this, it's actually a very well researched book with a broad range of examples related to each 'underground' food movement.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a culture shift to deal with in understanding the motivation for a few of the topics from my perspective, but i think that's because I'm already interested in food, so grasping how dire the monoculture practices of US supermarkets actually are was tricky.</p>
<p>I found somewhere to buy raw milk today which is pretty cool. i absentmindedly drank 2 litres of it over the day, and if i'd done that with pasturised milk i'd be well on the way to being dead! <a href="http://www.realmilkaustralia.com./index.php?page_id=9">check this out - real milk</a></p>
