I got a bit of a telling off from Andrew when I was talking to him last week for not having any proper books on [my list](http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/2009/09/my-reading-list). There were some, but I just forgot to put them in.

There really should be an iframe here :(

The Na√Øve Set Theory is from the library and is a beautiful pre 1977 version with gold blocked text on the cover, and is for the course I'm about to do (starting tomorrow night - so I'll probably post up my homework).

The General Systems Theory seems to be out of print, but I've got what I think it a first edition from a web bookshop.

They are going to make a bit of a dent in my time compared to the other pop-science that is on that list!
