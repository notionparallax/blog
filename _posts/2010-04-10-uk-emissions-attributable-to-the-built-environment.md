<p>I’m trying to write about how much the built environment contributes to UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and i’m finding it to be very murky.</p>
<p>There is a figure of about 47 to 50%-ish but nobody references where they got this from, and nobody then subdivides it to show what that is made up of.</p>
<p>I’m on the bus at the moment, so i don’t really have access to the figures, but agriculture gets a big chunk, as does electricity generation, cement manufacturing gets a chunk, and transport gets a bit, and then the rest is left to ‘the built environment’.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, if it has a roof, it is built environment. This means that that 50% that gets attributed to “something that architects really should be doing something about” includes everything from all the computers in offices around the country, to aluminium smelters (which consume so much electricity that they often have their own power station!).<br />
What I’m after is the percentage of UK CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that are attributable to buildings, broken down into useful chunks. How much power does the building consume? To run the lifts, the HVAC, the lights?</p>
<p>There are a lot of grey areas here, like how much architects should get involved with specifying the IT infrastructure, so that it produces less heat, and therefore allows a reduction in cooling loads, but for the moment I just want simple numbers.</p>
<p>Does anyone have anything they can push my way? There’s a pint/mars bar in it for you!!</p>
