This is my undergraduate dissertation. I wrote it over 10 years ago so a lot of things have changed. I think the thing that has changed the most is me! I cringe a bit at the wildly overconfident statements I make, and the referencing is _terrible_. As tempting as it is to correct it, the person who wrote it doesn't exist any more so I've left it as is. There might also be some errors in formatting that have come in from the InDesign export process, mostly small caps becoming lower case.

If you want the original PDF then there's a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIWT_wqd-VmbTNOa1hqN3JmMzQ/view?usp=sharing">screen res copy here(8mb)</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwIWT_wqd-VmbjJibXlKRmwxVU0/view?usp=sharing">full res copy here (73mb)</a>. Click _more_ to get in on the html version, but it's a pretty heavy page so don't do it on the bus!

This got pretty badly mangled by a script that was supposed to convert my end notes from wordpress to jekyll. It's still healing.
