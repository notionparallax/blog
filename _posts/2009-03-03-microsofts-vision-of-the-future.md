<p>There is a lot of interesting stuff in here that seems reasonably plausable, seeing how far we've come in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The majority of things in this video are based on new hardware, none of the software seems all that far fetched. I wonder if it's because we aren't ready for suggestions about significant UI advances, or if they don't predict that things will change much?</p>
<p>However it's important to remember that this is made by the office team, and as such there are a whole load of things that they aren't especially bothered about. It'd be interesting to see how a matching video made by a variety of governments would look.</p>
