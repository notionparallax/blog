<p>GC user now has 1300 users, and the cheapo hosting that  it was on before just doesn't cut it any more.</p>
<p>Jalal is in the process of transferring gcuser from the  old clunky DNN windows server to a new sparkly sever, and content management system.</p>
<p>The data is all safe, its all very tedious back end stuff, and the end user experience should be much the same,  probaby just a different colour.</p>
