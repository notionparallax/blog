<p>I've got to Illustrate why questions on a questionnaire need to be of a range of difficulties. If they are all too hard then the distribution of answers will all be pushed up to one end, and too easy, the opposite. So I needed to <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving">shave a yak</a> until I had a good way to show this.</p>
<p>I parallel-posted this on the GC forum too, so if I'm going to be forced to open IE to post to the GC forum, I thought I'd do a decent job of it.</p>
<p>Below is the GCscript that draws a bell curve. It is almost entirely based on Daniel Shiffman's processing code on his website atÂ  <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/nature/week-1/">http://www.shiffman.net/teaching/nature/week-1/</a></p>
<p>It is driven by a point that controls the standard deviation (**?**<sup>**2** </sup>width of the bell) and the offset from zero (**?**) .</p>
<p>There are a few other variables, but these just change the size of the curve.</p>
<p>See how you get on with it and if it is at all useful.</p>
