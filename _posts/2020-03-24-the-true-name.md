When one has an unexpected amount of free time&mdash;and very tedious online training to avoid&mdash;one's mind strays onto some odd questions.

There is power in having and knowing a name, it's a token of meaning for that concept. So if you are talking about a person it's a lot easier, and more specific to talk about someone by name than by constructing the concept of that person every time[^sl]. E.g. _the tall person over there_ is open to all kinds of referential ambiguity, but _Charlie_ is fairly specific[^ch].

I've noticed this idea coming up a lot in things I've been reading. In the Earthsea books, Ursula Le Guin has a system of magic where knowing a thing's true name gives you ultimate power over it. Ged becomes master of the great dragon just by knowing its name. 

You could try to summon things at random by just saying all the words available in your language. That's a [huge space](http://web.archive.org/web/20160805180548/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt)[^twerk] (there are [171,476 words in the OED](https://www.lexico.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language)). There's something like [10<sup>80</sup> atoms in the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Matter_content_%E2%80%93_number_of_atoms)[^h2], and even if we only name things about the size of a [golf ball](https://www.quora.com/How-many-atoms-are-in-an-average-golf-ball) (8&times;10<sup>27</sup>) _and_ we assume that the universe is made of golf balls, then 10<sup>52</sup> is a good ballpark figure for the number of things that we might need names for. 

Even a very simple naming system like IPv6 has enough names[^nanda] in it to represent 3.4×10<sup>38</sup> addresses. An IPv6 address is 8 four figure hex digits. If there are ["15831 syllable candidates"](http://web.archive.org/web/20160805180548/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) then even if only 10% of them can go together, we could name everything in the golf-ball-universe with unique, [24](https://www.numberempire.com/combinatorialcalculator.php) syllable words. It's probably not feasible though,_Antidisestablishmentarianism_ is 12 syllables, so a 24 syllable word would be almost impossible to say[^syl]. 

That only takes into account words that are exactly 24 syllables long, if we allow shorter words too, we wouldn't need as many syllables, and things we name more often could have shorter names, like "I". If saying something's _true name_ gives you power over it then a simple name like _Ged_ would put you in real trouble! There must be more to magic than that!

> "Locke, in the seventeenth century, postulated (and rejected) possible language in which each individual thing, each stone, each bird and each branch, would have its own name."

<figcaption>Jorge Luis Borges, <cite>Labyrinths</cite>[^labCite] page 93

I'm not sure if this is a fictional quote or not, but a [quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=Locke%2C+in+the+seventeenth+century%2C+postulated+(and+rejected)+possible+language+in+which+each+individual+thing%2C+each+stone%2C+each+bird+and+each+branch%2C+would+have+its+own+name&rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU804AU804&oq=Locke%2C+in+the+seventeenth+century%2C+postulated+(and+rejected)+possible+language+in+which+each+individual+thing%2C+each+stone%2C+each+bird+and+each+branch%2C+would+have+its+own+name&aqs=chrome..69i57.516j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) finds that this line has been quoted by a load of writers, discussing Leibnitz, Kant, Locke, Berkley, so it's definitely resonated with other people.

This idea of quantifying a space of all possible names came from the idea in _The Dispossessed_[^dis] that everyone's name is generated by a computer to be unique. _Shevek, Bedap, Sabul_, all two syllable names. If there really are almost 16k syllables in English, then we could name a population of over 125 million (125&#8239;318&#8239;196) Odonians before we need a new naming system; probably more than dusty Urras can support.

[^syl]: I don't think there are any 24 syllable words in English, _[pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English)_ a word made up specifically to have a lot of syllables, only has 19 syllables.

[^sl]: (Some sign languages (most or all probably) have a technique that lets you construct an idea once, then place it and refer back to it later)[https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/indexing.htm].

[^earthseaCite]: Guin, Ursula K. Le. 2018. The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition. Orion Publishing Group.

[^ch]: Unless there's a bunch of Charlies, but that's less common, especially once the people talking have established a context.

[^h2]: Assuming that the universe is made of hydrogen, in practice it'd be a bit less, because other elements are heavier, but not by much, maybe 10<sup>78</sup> at most?

[^twerk]: 
    [This](http://web.archive.org/web/20160805180548/http://semarch.linguistics.fas.nyu.edu/barker/Syllables/index.txt) archived page is from about 2009, and asks " How many syllables does English have?". The amazing thing is that he seems to have unwittingly come up with the word "twerk", way before anyone else"

    "The syllabification algorithm is not particularly sophisticated or elaborate.  As a result, this list contains a number of strings of sounds that are not legitimate English syllables.  This is due to the fact that my data do not recognize morpheme boundaries, even though this affects syllabification.  For instance, the following two putative syllables are not actually legitimate syllables of English: 
    
    ```
    jh r ae k s     LUGGAGE-RACKS
    t w er k t      OUTWORKED
    ```
    "

    It shows up in the [Ngram record in the 70s](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=7&case_insensitive=on&content=twerk&direct_url=t1%3B%2Ctwerk%3B%2Cc0#t1%3B%2Ctwerk%3B%2Cc0), but that seems to be beause of a German power station.

[^nanda]: People say "names and addresses" but if you drop the navigational part of an address, then a name is basically the same thing.
