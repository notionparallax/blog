<p>Most people will have realised that I don't tend to do things the normal way. This extends to education too - I've taken 4 years off in the midst of a 5 year course (and 2 more before it even started). <a title="this needs a bit of updating now, there is ANOTHER year out to contend with!" href="https://notionparallax.co.uk/2008/what-on-earth-have-i-been-up-to">See this old post</a>.<br />
This year I'm back at school to do the last year before I become a 'real person' and start paying council tax etc. Oxford Brookes has a terrific system where they've figured out that you are probably about sick of design studios by the end of your 4<sup>th</sup> year, and are ripe for a bit of - shh don't say it too loudly - _learning_.<br />
This is my draft proposal for what I'm going to do. It is a bit woolly, as it covers up that I really don't actually know what it is that I am going to do, and it is only barely related to architecture.</p>
<blockquote><p>The 21st century is hailed by many as a 'make or break' time for humanity, the tipping point between a technological utopia and a crushing blow to our species' capacity to flourish. While every effort must be made to steer a path towards a bright future, contingencies for both extremes, as well as the vast, but discontinuous, range of circumstances and possibilities between must be considered.<br />
Only in a very perverse utopia, or particularly devastating catastrophe, does architecture cease to be pertinent (the importance of architects is less certain!).</p>
<p>The risk of global catastrophe, ranging from super volcanoes and runaway global warming to doomsday machines or bio-terrorism, is non trivial. The contingencies in place to contain or manage these events may (if successful) affect societies as much or more than the event itself. Conversely the potential for technology to enhance our lives beyond recognition is considerable. Indeed, it has already been realised. Genetic modification, cognitive enhancement and life extension are just a few of the possibilities.</p>
<p>With these great threats and opportunities come ethical questions about how, and whether, to manage the risks that the implementation of these opportunities (or whether to implement them at all!). While forecasting has its perils, as recent events in the financial sector have shown, it is foolhardy not to prepare to manage the outcomes of potential cataclysms. The continually diverging tree of all possible events makes the odds of a particular event, even in the relatively near future, vanishingly small. We need better tools. I intend learn how to develop a better understanding of the future, and the methods that can be used to improve predictions. Architecture is one of our most persistent projections into the future, there ought to be some consideration of what that future is going be like.</p>
<p>If getting past the next 90 years is really as fraught as is claimed (disasters, divergent societies, etc.) then we have a lot of work to do to get there, but it would make me feel better if I had a bit of an idea of what we'll find when we do.</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts on things I ought to be looking at then let me know.</p>
