<p>On Monday I’m going to go and interview <a href="http://www.aedas.com/Europe/JuditKimpian">Judit Kimpian</a> about her involvement in the <a href="http://www.bre.co.uk/carbonbuzz/">Carbon Buzz</a> project.</p>
<p>Carbon Buzz is a platform where people who design buildings can put their design stage building performance data from their simulations, and then compare it with real, in-use data. Check out the <a href="http://www.bre.co.uk/carbonbuzz/">website</a>, and there is the <a href="http://www.bre.co.uk/carbonbuzz/docs/CarbonBuzz_Handbook.pdf">Carbon Buzz handbook</a> too.</p>

<p>I’m interested in it for a number of reasons, mainly because it is one of the only chances in architecture where you get to see a comparison between design intent, and the delivered product. The apparent fact that the simulations are getting it so wildly wrong intrigues me too. If the designers of the simulations know that their calculations are so wrong, then why are they still used, hopefully Judit can shed some light on this!</p>
<p>Since the interview was organised the project has been <a href="http://blog.emap.com/footprint/2010/03/11/carbonbuzz-secures-3-year-funding">funded for another three years</a> by the <a href="http://www.innovateuk.org">Technology Strategy Board</a>, so we’ll get to see a continuation of this work.</p>
<p>If you have any questions that you'd like me to ask Judit then put them into the comments on this post. I'll publish the interview in a few days once it is edited.<br />
