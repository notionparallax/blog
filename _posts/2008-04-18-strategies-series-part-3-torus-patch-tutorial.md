<p>If we reduce the above image to a series of pairs of arcs, as long as they are the same radius, they can tiled with planar panels as the pairs will always have an arc between them, no matter how weird they mgiht look!</p>
<p>This means that as long as the radius stays constant, the path can do what it likes and the panels will remain planar.</p>
<p>There is, as aways, a pdf and a supporting GCT in the GCuser gallery</p>
