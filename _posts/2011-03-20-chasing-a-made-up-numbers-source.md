<p>A while ago <a title="UK emissions attributable to the built environment?" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2010/04/uk-emissions-attributable-to-the-built-environment/">I wrote about</a> the magical 45% number that is cited whenever anyone tries to justify their involvement in a built-environment project that seeks to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
<p>In the last few months I've made a few steps in finding the source of this number, and it seems that it might pay to be a bit more careful while using it in future. (_Seems_ - I'd like to know if anyone knows better.)</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-609 alignright" title="Total UK delivered energy consumption by sector in 2000" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guideFpie-297x300.png" alt="" width="297" height="300" />The most likely source of the number comes from <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/CIBSE-GUIDE-F-ENERGY-EFFICIENCY-IN-BUILDINGS-2004-.pdf">CIBSE guide F</a>. (Thanks <a href="http://designfordeconstruction.co.uk/">Sophie </a>for finding it, I know I've been a terrible bore about this subject.)</p>

<p>all adds up to 46% - eureka! It has been found! Lets just cross our Ts and dot our Is to be sure.</p>
<p>This table comes from the 'Digest of UK energy statistics (London: The Stationery Office)', and was published in 2000. There are a couple of tricky things here, one glaring, and one that takes a bit of digging. Firstly, 2000 was 11 years ago, and the odds are that the data are even older. 12 years ago I looked like <a title="A young me with long hair" href="http://bit.ly/fsIW6V">this</a>! These data are published annually and a lot happens in 12 years - is it still a valid number to be quoting? I had a look, and the stationary office doesn't publish that data any more, it is the the <a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a>'s thing.</p>
<p>The places that I've been most successful in finding useful information are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eurostat:Using official statistics to calculate greenhouse gas emissions: A statistical guide <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0YTPYTEjCDkJ:epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-31-09-272/EN/KS-31-09-272-EN.PDF+eurostat+how+emissions+are+calculated&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=au&amp;source=www.google.com.au">html version</a>, <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-31-09-272/EN/KS-31-09-272-EN.PDF">pdf</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://energy.gov/">Department of Energy</a> in the US</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is an up to date figure then I'd love to see it, it'd make me feel like much less of a fraud when I try to convince people about this kind of thing.</p>
