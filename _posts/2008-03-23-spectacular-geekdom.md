<p>I've spent my <a href="http://www.explosm.net/comics/858/">easter Sunday</a> tucked up in the <a href="http://www.sial.rmit.edu.au/">sial lab</a> with two of my urban best friends, my laptop for doing some work, and a whole load of video lectures.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/200803_martin.jpg" align="left" height="50" width="100" /><a href="http://www.21school.ox.ac.uk/video/200803_martin.cfm" target="_blank">'Target Earth' by James Martin </a> - a high speed trip through the possibilities and problems facing the human race in the next century, and what the 21st century school is doing to try and increase our chances of living through it!</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/20080317_236.jpg" align="left" height="75" width="100" /> <a href="http://webcast.oii.ox.ac.uk/index.cfm?view=Browse" target="_blank">Ted Nelson: 'A very general lecture'</a> - from the oii Ted Nelson Invented hypertext (a much as he tries to hide it), this is a terrific lecture in which he gets dressed up in a funny suit, sings songs and explains the history and future of the internet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.21school.ox.ac.uk/resources/video.cfm"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/200710_venter.jpg" align="left" height="50" width="100" />Genomics: From humans to the environment</a> - this was Craig Venter's talk that he gave for the Lames martin 21st century school at the sheldonian. lots of interesting stuff, and quite easy going considering that it's about sequencing genomes! <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/227">here's his TED talk</a> too<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/33207_132x99.jpg" align="left" height="99" width="132" /> <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/228">Alan Kay: A powerful idea about teaching ideas</a> - Alan Kay talks a bit about the sort of stuff that Seymour Papert talks about, giving children tools to learn with. a fascinating 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I think that officially makes me a mega geek.</p>
