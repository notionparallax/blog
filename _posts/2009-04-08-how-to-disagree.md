<p>I've been telling a lot of people about this recently, so I thought I'd put up a link to the source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/" title="essayist of spectacular insight">Paul Graham</a> has written an excelent guide to levels of didagreement, and by understanding these it makes it easier to upgrade your responses.</p>
<p>The general idea is that you can clasify disagreement into</p>
<li>DH0. Name-calling.</li>
<li>DH1. Ad Hominem.</li>
<li>DH2. Responding to Tone.</li>
<li>DH3. Contradiction.</li>
<li>DH4. Counterargument.</li>
<li>DH5. Refutation.</li>
<li>DH6. Refuting the Central Point.</li>
<p>I won't go into the details, you can see them worked out with much greater clarity <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I recently commented on a BD article, <a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3136686" target="_blank">Concern as English Heritage cites Wikipedia in listing submission</a>, and Verity Bird rebutted me. I've submitted a response, so hopefully that will be moderated soon and if it hasn't fallen off the radar we'll get a bit of a debate going!</p>
<p>My response level is currently about a DH4 though, so hopefully i'll get to DH6 in the not too distant future!</p>
