<p>Forgive me father for I have sinned - I've been really slack keeping this thing up to date, but as I have a bit more time at the moment, I will try and be a bit better. (not being in the slightest bit religious, I have no idea what comes next)</p>
<p>Here's a picture of my tomato, it's a singular tomato, but there are lots of flowers coming, so hopefully he won't be lonely for too much longer. The plants are really enjoying being tied up (kinky plants) and are now about 1.5 m tall. They provide ample screening for me to indulge in one of my favourite pastimes, namely strolling about my flat in just my pants.<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/n541400612_786532_4970.jpg" width="500" /></p>
<p>I'm off to see the Anthony Gormley exhibition in a bit, so I'll stick some photos up when I get the chance.</p>
