<p>I thought I'd spare you from my inept technical <s>writings</s> rantings for a bit and update what I’ve been doing.</p>
<p>Mostly for the last few weeks I’ve been in my office, vaguely working, and doing a lot of peripheral stuff. I’ve been linking the stuff I do into the back of this blog (see the tabs at the top) and doing too much GC related work for my own good (to the detriment of my studies) but hopefully I have all that under control, and I have teaching material for the next few weeks of my classes, and a bit of a presentation to give.</p>
<p>I managed to turn up to a meeting today a spectacular 24 hours early, which I think is the least late I’ve ever been for anything. Oh well, it’s good practice for tomorrow.</p>
<p>I worked all night on Saturday to get the presentation done, and then tried to get the train to go surfing, but they don’t run much on Sundays, so I grabbed my bike and headed the 20km down the bay to nicks place. There is a bit of a culture of cycling around the bay early Sunday morning, and there are always hundreds of roadies out in full team kit giving it some, but I can honestly say that I wasn’t overtaken at all, and I got a lot of very funny looks as I passed people in my flip flops, rolled up jeans and a hoodie.</p>
<p>There is a café about half way there that has it’s entire front covered with bikes hanging up, so I grabbed a latte and carried on. Latte’s are stronger here, not the pansy milk-fest that they feed you in the UK.</p>
<p>The morning’s surfing was great, I was popping up quickly, getting good diagonal takeoffs and some quite long rides, I just need to get them all together and I’ll be fine!</p>
<p>Then in the afternoon, I slept on the beach and periodically played with a really friendly S<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">taffordshire bull terrier</span> who kept waking me up by licking my face.</p>
<p>I went to a great talk this evening by Peter Harper from CAT, he presented the new CAT suggestions for how far and fast we ought to cut carbon emissions. It’s pretty drastic stuff, but it’s all very well researched, and even though I’m a<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zcb_logo.jpg" align="right" height="23" width="120" /> bit of a hippie when it comes to this stuff, I think it’s necessary. Take a look at <a href="http://www.zerocarbonbritain.com"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">the</span></a><a href="http://www.zerocarbonbritain.com"> report</a> and see for yourself!</p>
<p>I really need to get my sleep pattern fixed (more of it!) and do a bit more exercise. Sitting still all week and then thrashing myself for 8 hours can’t be a good way to live.</p>
