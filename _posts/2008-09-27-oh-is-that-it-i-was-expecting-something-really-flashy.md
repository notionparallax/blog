<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Lenovo+G400.JPG" width="230" align="right" height="191" />My new laptop is finally here, and it's exactly what I wanted, it's made of tanks, it's pretty light, and it's really boring! so somewhere in me, the littel kid is slightly upset that it isn't increadably 'cool', but what's really cool is beiang about to work for 3 hours in the bright sunshine in the brisbane botanic gardens, and then watch a film on my flight home. It's great to be able to work in cafe's, there is, in some sort of perverse way, less distraction in cafes than there is in my office. I'd imagine that it's something to do with my ADHD brain that needs some white noise to take the edge off my distractability.  Now I can write stuff on my own time, I'll put up some stuff about what I'm working on at the moment  over the next few days.</p>
