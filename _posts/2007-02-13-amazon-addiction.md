<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I've just had a look at the 'items you own' section of my Amazon profile, and it's over 300!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">It's like that moment in sex and the city when Cary does the mental arithmetic about her shoes and realises that's why she can't afford a house (shamefully metaphor I know)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">If I average my purchases to be <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">£</span>10 (a conservative estimate) then that's <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">£</span>3000 spent over the last 4 years on Amazon. I think that's enough to get a place at a Betty Ford clinic!</p>
