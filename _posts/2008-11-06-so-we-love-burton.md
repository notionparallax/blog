<p><font size="2">hi,<br />
this is a bit of an odd request, but a long time ago, i remember seeing an ad with a page ripped out of "in bed with madonna" with some of the 'key'<br />
words crossed out and replaced with snowboardy words.<br />
I don't suppose you have an archive of old ads, or any other way that I can get to see it again?<br />
thanks<br />
