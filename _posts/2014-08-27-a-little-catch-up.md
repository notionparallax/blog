<p>I feel like I'm a bit less constrained now that the first milli workshop is out of the way so I thought I'd just get some other ideas down. I haven't looked very hard to see if they exist; if they do that that's great and I'd love to hear about them!</p>
<h2>Rememberable Link service</h2>
<p>Short links are really useful if you want to be economical with characters, but they are a nightmare if you can't just click on it. The link to my <a href="http://goo.gl/kQnGJu">Github repo isÂ http://goo.gl/kQnGJu</a>. Imagine trying to read that down a phone to someone. If I make a new repo it suggests a name to me I just got _scaling-octo-batman_ and I've had _psychic-octo-nemesis_ in the past. These names are unique, memorable and easy to say. The idea for this service is to do that for links. They might end up being longer than their initial version, but for something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345529375/ref=s9_psimh_gw_p14_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0Y2DX89MZVZVXKCXYW8Y&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1688200382&amp;pf_rd_i=507846</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It'd be much nicer to be able to say <code>longlink.com/<a href="http://listofrandomwords.com/index.cfm?blist">uproar-batlike-detroit</a></code>. I think that generating good word triplets would be a fun problem, but it'd be handy.</p>
<h2>How was your day?</h2>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1691" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/btw-lifestyle-log.png" alt="btw lifestyle log" width="250" height="399" /><a href="http://beyondthewhiteboard.com/">Beyond the whiteboard</a> has a section where you fill in a form to rate your day. I had a look for an app that would do this more generally but couldn't come across the right words to find one. In the spirit of being lean I made one myself with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1l9UFfugBw7WojZvm2CWxJ_2enJ9fxV9ABbZeIv3KYNw/viewform?usp=send_form">google form</a> and an<a href="https://ifttt.com"> ifttt recipe</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">if<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/medium.png" alt="Date &amp; Time" width="20" height="20" />then<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/medium.png" alt="Gmail" width="20" height="20" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p>So for a little while I'll fill in a short questionnaire about how I'm feeling at 9pm every day. Hopefully this'll produce some good data to tie into the rest of my <a href="https://twitter.com/benlifestats">digital exhaust</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows if these things already exist then I'd love to hear about them!</p>
