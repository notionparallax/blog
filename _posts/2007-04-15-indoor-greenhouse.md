<p>I've been talking about this to anyone who will listen for ages now!</p>
<p>I have an enormous bay window in my living room that gets blasted by the sun between about 5am and 1pm everyday. it seems a shame to waste all that energy on the two ropey plants that came with my flat, so I've got myself a grow bag and some seeds and I'm growing tomatoes. I'll keep a tomato update going over the summer as they progress.</p>
<p>I think there is probably room for another 2 bags in there, so I'll grow a few mint plants, in one, but I'm still searching for ideas for the other one.</p>
<p>This takes the idea of local food to a whole new level!</p>
