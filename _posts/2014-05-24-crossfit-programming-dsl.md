<p>Trying to describe a workout using a logging tool like beyond the whiteboard is pretty hard if your coach likes to be a bit creative with his programming. I was wondering if there was much merit in trying to use ruby to describe the workouts.<br />
It seems to me that workouts are pretty composable things that lend themselves to being easily described this way. I haven't defined any specific <acronym title="domain specific language">DSL</acronym> yet, but they'd probably be useful.<br />
This is the result of barely any thought into it. I've going to try to iteratively improve this as I go along. There are probably a load of syntax errors too because it's been a while since I wrote any ruby!<br />
