<p>Ladies and gents, allow me to introduce <a title="Posted Notes" href="http://postednot.es">postedNot.es</a>!</p>
<p>It's a service to send hand written letters to people with minimal friction. You mash out a short note on the train to work and we transcribe it onto classy looking paper and post it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="&quot;We&quot; in this case is Irina Belova and me" href="http://postednot.es/#rules">We've</a> been working on it for a couple of weeks in between the perils of real life and we're quite pleased with it.</p>
<p>Of course it is better to send a nice 'Thank You' letter to someone, but at least for me this is always thwarted by at least one of these parts being missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>Pen</li>
<li>Envelope</li>
<li>Stamp</li>
<li>Trip to Post Office</li>
</ol>
<p>Which leads to me hoarding empty post cards, letters with no envelope or stamp, or whole, finished things that I just can't find time to take to the post office. These day it is unusual to send a letter and the whole process is fraught with difficulties.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say here is that it's better to get something rather than nothing! Nobody these days would chastise you for sending flowers rather than picking them yourself.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think you've got the point. Have a <a title="Posted Notes" href="http://postednot.es">look at the website and give it a go!</a></p>
