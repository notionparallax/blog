<p><img class="alignright" title="eco" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/eco.PNG" alt="eco" width="275" height="203" />I made this a really long time ago, and it still isn't finished, but it woul'd be better for the world if it was out there making people happy (what rot).</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been working on an Ecotect training document for a while, it is still a work in progress, but see what you think so far. <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpressImages/intro%20to%20ecotect.pdf">Ecotect for site analysis</a></p>
<p>as it is a work in progress, if you want to put notes on the tutorial and send it back, that’d be very much appreciated!</p>

<p>I snuck it onto the tutorials page a while ago, but I didn't announce it. If there is enough enthusiasm in the comments I'll carry on working on it.</p>
