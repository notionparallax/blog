<p>I just found a piece of my work <a href="http://ecoinnovationlab.com/design-studios/meals-in-metropolis" target="_blank">published on the VEIL website</a>!</p>
<p>It's a proposal to reuse multistory carparks as mushroom farms until they are demolished and replaced with something more usefull than inner city parking.</p>
<p>There is more detail on the VEIL site about the project.</p>

<h6><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-weight: bold;">“The Mushroom Carpark”  - Ben Doherty**<br />
This exploration offers an innovative approach to redesigning car parking stations into transitionary resources which could be used for mushroom production. Ben suggests that in the short-term future there will be reduced car use due to high fuel prices and the subsequent uptake of car-sharing schemes and cycling. The ensuing reduction of car use will provide a new wasted space – car parks.</h6>
