<p>Making a reactive component and Programming a ScribbleI noticed that the version of the GC tutorials on the tutorials page isn't very up to date</p>
<p>Here's the latest, <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/2009-03-30a-Making-a-reactive-component-and-Programming-a-Scribble.pdf">all in one special version<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/il_430xN_44257688.jpg" alt="all in one - onesie" /></a></p>
<p>There are some bits and bobs that need updating (all the icons have changed, thanks guys) but you'll get the gist of things...</p>
