<p>I've upgraded the software behind the blog, so now the comments should work, which means that you can be as abusive as you like. It was incredibly difficult, but that's because I was doing it wrong. Always the case. The nice pictures will be back soon, but I deleted them when I did the new upload, so I'll have to get them back off my hard drive.</p>

I've got into writign lists again (pda -  out, oldschool tech - in)<br />
I've discovered that every litre of water i drink allows me to work for about another hour.</p>
<p>Spiffing.</p>
