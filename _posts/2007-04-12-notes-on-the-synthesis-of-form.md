<p>I'm currently writing a piece about Christopher Alexander's book Notes on the synthesis of form. I've read part one about 4 times now and it's either warpign my brain, or he had a good point to start with because I'm starting to agree with a lot of what he says (part 2 is a differnt story)<br />
I did a little presentation about it a while ago, it's <a href="http://wiki.uelceca.net/avamsccomputingdesign/files/Notes+on+the+synthesis+of+form+BD.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to have a look.</p>
<p>I'll even post the essay when it's done! Now don't you feel lucky</p>
