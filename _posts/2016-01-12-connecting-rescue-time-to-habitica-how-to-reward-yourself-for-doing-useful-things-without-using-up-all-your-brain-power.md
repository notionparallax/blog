<p>I like <a href="https://habitica.com" title="formerly Habit RPG">Habitica</a> a lot. I find that it's good at <a href="http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Adapting_HabitRPG_for_ADHD">directing my attention</a> and motivating me to do things that are aligned with my goals[^1]. I also use <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">Rescue Time</a>, it's job is to tell me what I really do with my life. It stops me lying to myself about what my days look like.

<figcaption>This graph is my productivity over the last 6 months. (As reported by Rescue Time.) It's inaccurate because it mostly isn't tracking my laptop[^2], but as I do most of my unproductive time in phone and tablet land it's probably well recorded there.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've tried manually inputting habits in the past. If I worked well for an hour I'd give myself a point. But if I was really working I'd forget to put in the point, and if I was actually just barely working I'd remember. Generally reinforcing the wrong habit.</p>
<h2>Enough intro, onto the nerd stuff!</h2>
<p>IFTTT and Zapier both have a connection to Rescue Time. They both have a way of emitting cURL commands too. IFTTT through the Maker channel and Zapier through webhooks.</p>
<p>That means that if I do something in real life then I can be rewarded or punished in Habitica land.</p>
<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zaps.png" alt="zaps" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2723" />
<figcaption>I've started off with a reward for reading. I get a point for each time I accrue 20 minutes of reading a kindle book or articles in Pocket.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>How do I unlock this sorcery?</h2>
<p>I'll do this for Zapier because it's easier to test, but the same holds for IFTTT[^3]. You can also swap out Rescue Time for any other trigger too. So if you want to get a reward when you go into the gym's geofence then you can.</p>
<p>Obvious stuff: get a Zapier/IFTTT and Habitica account.</p>
<p>You are going to need to get your <a href="https://habitica.com/#/options/settings/api">Habitica API details; they live here</a>. (The _User ID_ and _API Token_.)</p>
<p>Once you've got your ingredients all ready then you can get going!</p>
<p>Pick something you want to be rewarded (or punished) for. Something that Rescue Time tracks. Then make <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/categories">a custom subcategory for it</a>.[^4] Then set a <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/goals">new goal</a>. </p>
<figure>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/goal.png" alt="goal" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2726" />
<figcaption>Set it to the category you want and then how long you need to spend doing it before the trigger fires.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You're all done in Rescue Time now.</p>
<p>Go to Zapier and <a href="https://zapier.com/app/editor">make a new Zap</a>. </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zap1.png" alt="zap1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2729" /></p>
<p>Set it to be triggered by your goal.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/zap2-1.png" alt="zap2" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2728" /></p>
<p>Now for the voodoo part. There is a good page on the <a href="http://habitica.wikia.com/wiki/Application_Programming_Interface">Habitica wiki that explains everything I'm about to say</a>. I was having a severe stupid when I was reading it, so in case my words are useful, then here they are.</p>
<p>The call to the API is a POST like this:</p>
<p><code>https://habitica.com/api/v2/user/tasks/<span class="name">read20minutes</span>/<span class="direction">up</span></code></p>
<p>The bit in red is the name of the habit. (Multiple triggers can aim at the same habit.) The green bit is either <code>up</code> or <code>down</code> depending on where you want your score to go.</p>
<p>That goes into the URL field.</p>
<p>This is the part that I spent all the time on. Your authentication details go in the header, not the body. That's right at the end of section 5. Make 2 new key, value pairs with your details.</p>
<figure>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2730" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/keys.png" alt="keys" />
<figcaption>That's <code>x-api-user: xxxxx</code> and <code>x-api-key: xxxxx</code> if you are playing along at home.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That's it! don't change anything else and you'll be just fine.</p>
<p>Test it in step 6, name it in step 7 and away you go!</p>
<p>When you test it you should see a new Habitica habit show up. Then if you test it again it'll go green. (Unless you're a punisher and you picked <code>down</code>!)</p>
<p>And that is that.</p>
<p>If you have any clever ideas for other things to join up then let me know. I'm a total sucker for this stuff.</p>

[^1]: i.e. it gets me to do things that the good version of myself thinks are useful. The things that--given some time to think about it and plan--I would want to be doing.

[^2]: Rescue Time for Linux is a process that you need to start manually. I'm sure that's the Linux way, but it's super annoying. "Just make a startup script" sure, one day.
