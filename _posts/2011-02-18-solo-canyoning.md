Tomorrow I'm going to go nice and early to the blue mountains to do a pair of canyons, <a href="http://www.tdmskp.com.au/guide/index.php?title=Juggler_Canyon">Jugglers</a> and the <a href="http://www.tdmskp.com.au/guide/index.php?title=Grand_Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. I'll be solo, so it should be relatively fast, but even so, it'll be a fairly long day. I'm going to try for the Blue Mountains train Dep: _3:48am_ Sydney Terminal Platform 7 Arr: _5:50am_ Katoomba Station Platform 2, then cycle to near the start of the canyon (<a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=&amp;daddr=Grand+Canyon+Rd&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=FSpP_v0dj8H1CA&amp;mra=mr&amp;sll=-33.665211,150.323653&amp;sspn=0.034861,0.063386&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=15">here</a>). Assuming a worst case scenario for time, I'd say that the latest that I'll be out of the canyon and back to the bike will be 6pm. I'll update with a comment here to say that I'm back safely.</p>
<p>I've got a new camera, so there will be photos!</p>
