<p>One of the reasons that I've been so remiss with posting recently (as in for the last 2 years) is that my old server had got so old that it wouldn't let me. I've scrapped the surpass server, and I've got a shiny Linode box in Tokyo that lets me do all kinds of Ubuntu magic.</p>
<p>It is very cool being able to SSH in from my phone and download stuff - I'm sure I'll get bored of that kind of thing sooner or later, but at the moment it's fun. One of the key things that I have on there now is IPython notebook and RStudio server, which means that I can do useful stuff from anywhere I can get to a modern browser.</p>
<p>I've also switched the address for this blog from notionparallax.co.uk/blog to just notionparallax.co.uk</p>
<p>Phew, this is a boring post         !</p>
