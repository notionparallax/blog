I'm going to be teaching at UTS again this coming semester. Another intrepid cohort will be subjected to my odd views on things, and I hope that it'll rub off a bit on them[^1].

This time I'm giving <a href="http://utsapocalypse.net/blog/2012/02/15/the-start-of-the-story/">the start of a story</a> for them to finish off with a building. The exciting bit is that there isn't the usual set of constraints (read the story for the details), one of the two submissions will be by video, and there will be energy system modeling using grasshopper that feeds into some infographics.

I'll put the full details on the <a href="http://utsapocalypse.com">UTSapocalypse</a> website when they are a bit more polished, so keep an eye on it.
