<p>This is something I'd meant to post a really long time ago but got distracted by having to, well, do stuff. We've got a pretty normal looking kettle, and when you fill it up it feels like you fill it for a pretty normal amount of time, but I was interested to see how much we were actually putting into it (I was reading <a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">Sustainable energy without the hot air</a> at the time, so it all makes sense).</p>
<p>It turns out that we were putting about three times as much water as we needed to to make two mugs of tea. What this little experiment did show was that one of the jars that tomato paste comes in is just right for two mugs of tea, so the jar lives by the kettle now.</p>
