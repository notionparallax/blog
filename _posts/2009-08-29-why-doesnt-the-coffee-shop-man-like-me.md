<p> To  say that I'm a little disorganised* would be a gross understatement  of the truth, but I'm developing ways to deal with it.</p>
<p> I've  got a mobile internet dongle, so I can indulge my outrageous  dependency on the internet from wherever I am, I carry at least one  of my laptops almost everywhere I go, and I did have a fantastic todo  list linked to my blackberry, (but alas no more, when I left  Australia I surrendered my badge and gun) - so I'm getting there.</p>
<p> All  this is no guard against my chronic laziness though. Which is why we  find ourselves, dear reader, in the courtyard of the Parisiene cafe  (predictive wants to write parasite - curiously appropriate) in Bath.  Today is my friend NeAl is getting married to Sarah, and I'm wrapping  their present in a cafe after nipping into a smiths and buying  wrapping paper with monsters on it.</p>

<p> I  bought a coffee, much to the detriment of my new year's resolution  never to buy coffee I suspect will be bad. I queued up, and a  gentlemen in his 40s was driving a<a href="http://www.laspaziale.com/english/s3_seletron_scheda_en.html"> La  Spaziale S3</a>  , my expectations were temporarily buoyed up, and I thought &quot;this  man clearly owns this place, and he cares enough to buy a really  great machine, he cares enough to drive it himself, and he cares  enough to actually be on the floor of his own place on a Saturday,  when judging by the number of customers, he could be sunning himself  in Spain&quot;.</p>
<p> But  alas, he wasn't the caring sort, he made a cappuccino in a matter of  seconds with no love, or even care, dolloped a mini Eager Of dry  froth onto the top of some burnt milk (with a thermometer sticking  out of it, so any claim of ignorance falls on deaf ears, only  complacency can explain this) and then my desperate cry of &quot;no  chocolate&quot; was to no avail, and the inevitable slick of  Cadburies finest was summoned to pollute my Eiger.</p>

<p> And,  my dearest reader, do you know who I blame? Me - it is entirely my  fault. by not telling this poor gentlemen that his barista skills are  sorely wanting I have done him a great disservice, I have deprived  him of one of the most valuable learning tools out there - feedback,  and for this I am more complicit in the gross injustice dealt to the  British coffee drinker than an innocent.</p>
<p> Let's  hope that this note finds its way back to its protagonist, and my  apology is accepted.</p>
