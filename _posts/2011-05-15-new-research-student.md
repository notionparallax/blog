[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jay_ear.png) Jay](http://www.the10thletter.info/)
is a final year student at UNSW doing [architectural computing](http://www.fbe.unsw.edu.au/futurestudents/Undergrad/BArchComp/). He is interested in using the Microsoft Kinekt as a part of the architectural workflow, BVN, and by proxy I, will be the 'client' on this project so I'm excited to see what he comes up with. There is already a huge background in UI for design, so he is currently doing a lit review of that work. He's posting his reviews of papers and other useful sources [here](http://10thletterresearch.blogspot.com/).

With Flora's [ubimash](http://ubimash.com/) work there is already a substantial technical basis for this work so there is a great possibility to do some really interesting user-focused work.
