<p>It seemed fitting that while I struggled to print this semester's work, that I should be thinking about the next one. Now that I've finished this semester I can start writing it all down...</p>
<p><a href="http://photos-d.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v117/100/0/538805146/n538805146_982859_6587.jpg" target="_blank">Matt Gaskin</a> has a little something planned, which will be in place ready for my return. It's essentially an extension of  the existing and already very successful <a href="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/schools/be/architecture/postgraduate/diploma/majorstudy.html" target="_blank">major study</a> special route. As far as I can tell from afar, it's notionally a student led studio, with a remit to do whatever we like. The initial discussions are happening via a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups.php?ref=sb#/group.php?gid=19762371453">facebook group</a>.</p>
<p>My fascination with the far future is continuing, and now that I have a little time, I'm going to try and catch up on my reading. In the meantime, here's a few of the websites that I've found recently that are related.</p>
<p><a href="http://onsingularity.com/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CommunityLogo.png" height="60" width="65" />onsingularity.com</a> - <span class="description">User-submitted news and discussion portal for the Singularity community, basically an aggregation of articles.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://jetpress.org/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/JET.JPG" height="50" />jetpress.org</a> - the journal of the...</p>
<p><a href="http://ieet.org"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/l6211041607_8086.jpg" height="50" />ieet.org</a> - institute for ethics and emerging technologies</p>
<p>There are plenty more, and I really ought to do a proper 'literature reviw at some point, but the general gist of things is:</p>
<p>The future is coming, in my opinion, far faster than we think it is (sounds like an impossibility, but as a question of perceptions, it's very possible)</p>
<p>I have no idea what this all has to do with architecture, it may well render architecture totally irrelevant if we all end up hooked into an experience machine, but it's probably best that we are aware of what's going on, and hopefully something will come of it.</p>
<p>I need to read a _lot_ more and then try and pin down a question.</p>
