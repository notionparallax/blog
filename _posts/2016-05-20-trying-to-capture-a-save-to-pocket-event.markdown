I wanted to be able to track how many people save articles to Pocket from this site. I thought that given how much [I use](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2014/offline-reading) [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@ben.doherty), other people who read my stuff might do the same.

I contacted Pocket support and they said that their browser extensions don't emit an event when it's clicked[^1]. I was hoping to be able to drive a Google analytics goal when that happened.

Pocket suggests that I look at their [Publisher stats][2], which is nice, but it's two sources of information. I wanted to be able to do it all in Google Analytics.

I hacked the following together from the [MDN MutationObserver][1] docs, but it relies on Pocket not changing the classname of their UI. (And leaving it in the DOM, not as a separate overlay.) I left it [on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37036606/can-a-save-to-pocket-be-detected) for a week to see if anyone was going to call me out for being a chump. They didn't; I guess the internet had better things to do this week.

```js
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    //your other events events...
    //ga('send', 'event', [eventCategory], [eventAction], [eventLabel], [eventValue], [fieldsObject]);

    function registerPocketSave() {
        console.log("looking for Pocket saves");
        // This is for Chrome only :(
        var target = document.querySelector("body");

        // create an observer instance
        var observer = new MutationObserver(function (mutations) {
            mutations.forEach(function (mutation) {
                //console.log(mutation);
                let a = document.getElementById("pkt_ext_master");
                if (a) {
                    console.log(a, "found a Pocket save - firing a GA event!");
                    ga("send", "event", "Pocketed", document.title);
                    observer.disconnect(); //once we've saved to Pocket, stop so that we don't get ghost versions
                }
            });
        });

        // configuration of the observer:
        var config = { attributes: true, childList: true, characterData: true };

        // pass in the target node, as well as the observer options
        observer.observe(target, config);
    }
    registerPocketSave();
});
```

It's actually running on this page right now, and it sort of works. It's only for Chrome. The Chrome extension mofifies the DOM and injects a popup, but the Firefox extension uses the new DOM provided by the extension's own little window.

If anyone has any suggestions then I'd love to hear about it!

[^1]: Actually I only asked about their Chrome extension, but I'm guessing that's common to Firefox too. Pocket support were actually really helpful about this.
