<a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-hierarchy-of-digital-distractions/">This diagram</a> of potential distractions is pretty cool (and painfully thought provoking).

This'd be really cool if it had an interface so that people could customise it to match their own personal distraction hierarchy. maybe if i get really bored I'll do mine.

I'd have to add in my dad wanting to talk about DIY, the sun making it too hot to work in my shed, and nearly falling off my gym ball chair substitute.
