<p>This is a bit of a UTS architecture classic, I think I first heard about it from <a href="http://post-traumaticurbanism.com/" title="Adrian's website - Post-Traumatic Urbanism">Adrian Lahoud</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Tarsha-Finney/681629873">Tarsha Finney</a> a few years ago, and Friday's class was the first chance I've had to really try it out. </p>
<p>The format is simple, split the class in half, and sit the two halves facing each other. Then get them to talk about their ideas for 4 minutes. I had everyone sitting pretty close together - it gets pretty noisy but it seems to pump up the endergy a bit. Once the 4 minutes is up you get one side of the group to rotate. Then start again.</p>
<p>It got <a href="http://utsapocalypse.net/meljoanne/2011/03/18/speed-dating/">good feedback</a> from the class. It's almost _too easy_, it feels a bit like cheating! Because of the short time and high energy the ideas seem to flow so quickly. There is a bit of a problem with how to rearange the group so that the static ones get to talk to each other too, but I'd imagine that once I get around to reading <a href="http://grouptheoryinthebedroom.com/" title="thanks to Ben Barnes for suggesting that one">group theory in the bedroom</a> I'll have a way to fix that.</p>
<p>I had an odd number so I popped the odd one off the end and gave them a 4 minute write up session so that they could capture their ideas.</p>
