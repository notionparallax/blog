<p>I took a double take at this poster for <a href="http://www.worldwarzmovie.com/">WWZ</a>, I thought that it might be one of my students getting into recycling their work!</p>
<p>In moving servers I seem to have broken the UTSapocalypse blog or I would have linked across to some work. It's not permanent, I'll get it moved over to this server sometime soon.</p>
<p>Looks like TIme Out rounded up all Sydney's disaster experts and got them all to write a bit (<a href="http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/the-bridge/features/9359/apocalypse-sydney-part-1">1</a> & <a href="http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/the-bridge/features/9365/apocalypse-sydney-part-2">2</a>) Sadly they seem to have 'overlooked' me!</p>
