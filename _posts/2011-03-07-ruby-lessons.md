Lessons 1-4 are written, and 1&amp;2 are even spell checked! If you want to join in, then do <a href="http://bvnruby.wordpress.com/lesson-1/">lesson 1</a> and then put your homework in the comments.<br />
If you want to come to see me explaining it all, then lessons 2&amp;3 will be on the coming two Mondays (then it's SG and UK for a bit!!).</p>
