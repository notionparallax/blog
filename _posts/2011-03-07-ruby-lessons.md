<p><a href="http://bvnruby.wordpress.com/lesson-1/"><img class="alignright" title="strings" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imag0137.jpg?w=584" alt="" width="280" height="265" /></a>I've just started running a set of Ruby programming lessons for Sketchup here in the studio at BVN.<br />
Lessons 1-4 are written, and 1&amp;2 are even spell checked! If you want to join in, then do <a href="http://bvnruby.wordpress.com/lesson-1/">lesson 1</a> and then put your homework in the comments.<br />
If you want to come to see me explaining it all, then lessons 2&amp;3 will be on the coming two Mondays (then it's SG and UK for a bit!!).</p>
