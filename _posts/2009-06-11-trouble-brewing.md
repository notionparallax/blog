<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/victoria_arduino_poster.jpeg" align="left" />James Hoffman posted a <a href="http://www.jimseven.com/2009/05/30/brewed-coffee-and-the-uk">great article</a> about the public's perception of the value of coffee. As I see it, his general gist is that the coffee industry in general talks too much and does too little to raise the quality of the product.</p>
<p>This parallels a lot of conversations that I've been having recently about the business of architecture. Read the article, and especially <a href="http://www.jimseven.com/2009/05/30/brewed-coffee-and-the-uk/#comment-96311">this comment</a>, as it's very interesting - then read it again and try swapping architecture for coffee and see what you think.</p>
