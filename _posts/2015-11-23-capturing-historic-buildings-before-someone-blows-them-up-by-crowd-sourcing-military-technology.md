<p>It's end of semester here in Australia. That means final presentations. I tutored the graduation project subject for UNSW's architectural computing degree[^1] so I got to see their work presented on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="tldr">Tl;dr: Free photogrametry and mesh networks could be used to document historical buildings and artefacts if they are at risk of a nutter blowing them up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the projects by <a href="http://benv2426-aram-odesh.blogspot.com.au/">Aram Odesh</a> was about using free photogrametry tools to preserve historic buildings. His argument was that major buildings would get laser scanned eventually by groups with big budgets, but there was a gap at the other end of the market that would slip through the cracks. His project was a comparison of the tools that you can use to scan buildings and objects using a mobile phone. The idea being that enthusiast groups would build up libraries of historic buildings in some, as yet unbuilt, repository[^2].</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how this kind of citizen scanning might be useful in other situations.</p>
<p>Could we use this to build 3D maps of cities? I'd imagine that self driving cars will be constantly mapping the cities that they are in, but they won't be everywhere. That leaves a gap where they don't, or can't, go. Citizen scanning could plug that gap, but so could extra investment from rich cities and corporations who want the data.</p>
<p>The other angle is military[^3]. There's a lot of action going on in various old cities. My guess is that these cities change fast and are therefore are probably pretty poorly mapped. They also have a bunch of important historical stuff in them. Military groups spend a long time scanning cities before they invade them. This lets them do simulations, work out what's around the next corner, that kind of thing. They send in drone planes with scanners on them to do this. The planes are mesh networked so that if one is lost there is minimal information lost.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/23/8267387/firechat-greenstone-mesh-network-bluetooth-wifi-peer-to-peer">messaging apps</a> that work by mesh networking. These are for places where the network isn't up to speed. That's either places like SXSW where there are a zillion people, or places where there just isn't a network.</p>
<p>I'm imagining a situation where citizens[^4] can create a mesh network, then use that for all the regular stuff a normal network is used for. Including scanning artefacts of historical importance[^5]. Something along the lines of _Heritage artefacts are unique, but we can always make another life_.]. Then you could set priorities on the network so that vital messages got moved quickly and scan data got pushed whenever there was space.</p>
<p>Turns out that this isn't a new idea (I doubt anything I think up ever is). <a href="http://projectmosul.org/">Project Mosul</a> is doing this but without the mesh networks.</p>

There really should be an iframe here :(

<p><a href="https://urcventures.com">URC Ventures</a> are doing it too. They've got some really cool videos of the results.</p>

<p>This is just another one of those situations where someone can put two existing technologies together to solve a problem!</p>

[^1]: with <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/m-hank-haeusler-40998110">Hank</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivana-kuzmanovska-6b581565">Ivana</a>

[^2]: perhaps it'll be Google Maps. imagine some kind of VR, free-location version of street view.

[^3]: I seem to talk about military things so much at the moment. I wonder why?

[^4]: The term citizen feels like it might be a bit tricky in places with really uncertain politics. Like I've always been confused by the idea of nation, country, state etc. I think citizen implies that there is something to be a citizen _of_. I this case, I mean concerned and invested occupant of a location. I'd love to know if anyone has written about this sort of thing anywhere else.

[^5]: I can imagine some people making an argument that in times of extreme danger, preserving the heritage is more important than saving life. I'm not sure where I stand on this issue. I need to think about it a lot. I can think of compelling reasons both ways. Ideally it wouldn't be a choice, we could do both.
