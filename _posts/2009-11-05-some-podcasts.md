<p>My dear readers, my capacity for providing witty insight is pretty limited, so today I am going to serve up some other people's chatterings to edify while my brain turns to ecstatic mush from eating <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7CpMITDLYc&amp;feature=player_embedded">monster munch</a>.</p>
<p>I've been trying to find out about economics, it seems that it hasn't got all that much to do with business, so that's a relief. one of the best things I've found so far is <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/">Econtalk</a>. It's all pretty old school free market stuff, but there are some great interviews, like this one with <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2007/05/hanson_on_healt.html">Robin Hanson</a> about healthcare and how mental people are.</p>
<p>With the Econtalk podcasts lasting over an hour, the <a href="http://philosophybites.com/">philosophy bytes</a> podcasts are a brief 15minutes of crisply edited questioning. I couldn't really pick out a star, but have a listen, they fit well onto bus rides.</p>
<p>There are a tonne on the Oxford uni podcasts site, if you have <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQBmTvIwfCQ&amp;feature=player_embedded">itunes</a> you can use itunes U. I've just listened to the talk that Nick Stern did on the <a href="http://www.21school.ox.ac.uk/downloads/podcasts/200702_stern_full.mp3?">economics of climate change</a>. The <a href="http://media.podcasts.ox.ac.uk/oucs/oxonian_interviews/bostrom_interview.mp3">intro the FHI </a>that Nick Bostrom did is pretty good too.  There are a load there that are worth a listen.</p>
<p>There are a lot of video lectures on the Berkeley site, but they can't be downloaded which is an arse. There is a course 'Quantitative Aspects of Global Environmental Problems' which I'd like to follow some day when I have a spare second.</p>
<p>There are a few others, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/">blogging heads</a>, <a href="http://www.longnow.org/seminars/02009/jan/16/climate-change-recalculated/">the long now</a>, <a href="http://fora.tv/2006/03/10/Next_100_Years_of_Science">fora.tv</a> and a few that I have forgotten.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any other suggestions?</p>
