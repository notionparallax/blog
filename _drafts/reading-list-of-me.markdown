I made this draft in 2016, and at the time, I thought that it was an original, useful idea. I'm less bullish about it's usefulness as a way to get someone up to speed with your thinking process. I am now much more interested to think about how this list changes over time.

Looking back at this list with 4 years of hindsight, there are definitely books on here that I wouldn't _think_ to put on my current list, but might actually deserve a spot.

I listened to Anathem as an audio book over Christmas, and I still think that it is a great book, but I'm going to bump it because I don't use its configuration space/many worlds idea as much as I did. Island is getting bumped because it's not quite as good as the two new entries from Ursula Le Guin. Lastly, I'm going to bump Alice, because if you haven't read that, then you've probably no business reading any of the other books here anyway.

That leaves me three slots for new Entries:

1. [The Disposessed](https://www.amazon.com/Dispossessed-S-F-MASTERWORKS-Ursula-Guin-ebook/dp/B0151Q54OE/ref=sr_1_1)
