I've had a Kindle since 2012, it has changed my relationship with physical books a lot.

People have pretty complicated relationships with books. There seems to be a sacredness attached to the physical manifestation of a book that isn't there for most other objects. Thoughts of [book burning](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/book-burning)[^burn] and deep discomfort accompany any suggestion of damaging or throwing out a book; probably one of the factors leading to the popularity of [street libraries](https://streetlibrary.org.au/)[^lib]. People talk about the smell of books, and the benefits of tactility when holding the book.

Traditionally the book concept, the idea that the word "book" pointed at was one thing: a stack of leaves with symbols on them that contain meaning[^stack]. Books have been caught up in [the great unbundling](https://stratechery.com/2017/the-great-unbundling/) and had their concepts carefully split apart. There's book as: (in order of obviousnes)

- **repository of content**: Content can now be delivered through anything with a screen[^gul]
- **desired object**: If a book is a beautiful thing, sometimes even regardless of its content, then it's something that people will want. That might be a circular explanation, but it's worth mentioning. Historical books like the [Lindisfarne Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Gospels) were pretty fancy:
  > The Gospels are richly illustrated in the insular style and were originally encased in a fine leather treasure binding covered with jewels and metals made by Billfrith the Anchorite in the 8<sup>th</sup> century.
- **signalling device**: Reading a book in a bar, or on a train, tells other people that you're a certain type of person. This can be a pretty useful flex, or helpful mating call!
- **residual object**: This is everything else. It's the inconvenience of shelving your books (which costs money) of moving them to your new house.

Having read so many books on Kindle, I've got a bit of insight into the other side too. Reading on a screen gives you a very minimal augmented reality reading experience. Your book becomes searchable, you can look up words that you don't know just by touching them, you can highlight and make notes without any damage to the object, you can even change the typesetting to suit your feelings on the day[^font]. All up, it's just more convenient. To steal the photography quip, the best book is the one you have with you, and having a whole library on my phone and Kindle means that I've always got something to read.

That said, there's no meta-level pleasure to an ebook.

> As a boat lover I remember when fiberglass boats first came along in the 1950s, and everyone said they would never work, never sell, never last. Wrong on every count. Fiberglass boats are lighter and stronger than wood, more intricately shaped, and they endure negligent owners, which wood cannot, because they are immune to teredo worms, dry rot, and baking sun. Fiberglass never leaks; wood always does, top and bottom. And yet a magazine called _Woodenboat_, founded in 1969, became one of the all-time publishing successes through worshipping the virtues of wood in boats. Those virtues consist entirely of the aesthetics of tradition and the discipline of managing a short-lived material. I have owned and sold an excellent plastic boat and owned and kept a troublesome wooden boat. Why? The wood feels better, and I can fiddle with it. But if I really had to sail somewhere, I'd get fiberglass or steel.

The ones that can be appreciated for the luxury and cost of touchable aesthetics (or whose labor costs are irrelevant) will stick with traditional materials. And most of the advanced stuff will ever more convincingly, and ironically, imitate the traditional, leading civilization into what Umberto Eco calls "hyperreality"&mdash;the realm of the exaggerated, proud, absolute fake.

[^burn]: Organised book burning is a thing to be genuinely afraid of because it's an systematic destruction of knowledge. If it's the last copy of a text, then it's a tragedy to lose it. If it's one copy of a best seller, then it's no loss at all. It's similar to species extinction. In a quick search for _book burning_ there were a lot of results, so I'd imagine that society's odd relationship with it has been talked about at length!
[^lib]: This irrational reverence becomes clear when you look into most street libraries. They are packed with out of date technical manuals (Flash 4 for Dummies), or pulp romance books, that the owners couldn't bring themselves to recycle into toilet paper.
[^stack]: It's been long enough that we don't get caught up in debates about book vs scroll when we're thinking about texts. In many fields, the idea of _a text_ is even more pluralistic, pointing to anything that can be read and studied: movies, paintings, objects, as well as things that are written down.
[^gul]: This became very clear to me when I read Gulliver's Travels on my phone, a [Nexus One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_One) with a screen about the size of a credit card.
[^font]: I'll make the font bigger when I'm getting tired.
