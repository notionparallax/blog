There's a tension in language between changing so that we can keep being expressive as the world changes, and staying the same so that we can all understand each other. In the spirit of the latter, I've been collecting a list of words that get brutally misused, particularly by architecture students. I hope that by explaining how I think you should use the word, or how you should not use it, that we can all communicate a bit more clearly. If we can communicate clearly, then we can share more difficult ideas because we're not tripping over language.

Some of the words here are frequently misused, and some of them point to concepts that get misused. In both cases, I'm no grammatical expert, in fact I misspelled _grammatical_ as I typed it. I'm offering my opinion, and hopefully, together, we can work out a better way to talk and write about ideas.

> Good, better best

Optimisation is a process, a bit like heating. If you point a hair drier at a brick for 10 minutes, the brick gets warmer. It does _not_ become the hottest it can possibly ever be, and nobody expects it to be. Then, why do people expect that something that's been optimised will be optimal?

This is going to need a little diversion into what optimal means. It's a fancy word for _best_.

## Software/softwares

In the feedback for an otherwise excellent PhD thesis, the examiner, [Chris Williams](https://people.bath.ac.uk/abscjkw/) from Bath University, wrote something to the effect of "_Software should never be pluralised because it's a mass noun_". Which is something that had never occurred to me because, as Paul Coates would sometimes say "I learned English by speaking it", not because I was actually taught it formally.

There's something in linguistics called an [over regularisation error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(linguistics)), e.g. "gooses" instead of "geese". As kids learn a language they often make these sorts of mistakes as they figure out grammar, but not where the irregularities go. Mass nouns are particularly tricky here because there's no rule about what is and isn't one as far as I know. Sheep, fish, software, furniture, they're all tricky to pluralise, because nothing happens.

This matters when you stand up at a conference and tell the audience that you used Rhino, Revit and MS Paint to solve your problem. Then you say "these softwares were..." and it gets spooky! 

You can solve most of these grammatical problems with a substitution trick. If you swap out the word _software_, with the word _furniture_, it should still work.

> "We used five pieces of software to do this job."

> "We used five pieces of furniture to do this job."

The even simpler trick is to remember that "softwares" isn't a word, and you should never say it!
