The [robots are coming](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/business/economy/threatened-by-machines-a-once-stupid-concern-gains-respect.html) for [your jobs](https://twitter.com/vgr/status/740224704565252097) idea is gaining some amazing momentum.

I've had lots of interesting conversations recently about this. I started off being sceptical of the claim, but I've become solidly ambivalent[^1]. My previous feeling was that creative destruction would always keep. It would replace the coopers and farriers with UX designers and IP lawyers;  I'm much less sure now. The sheer speed at which the change is likely to happen is so much greater than anything we've ever experienced before.

Northern British cities grew spectacularly in
the industrial revolution. It all happened over a 200 year period. The effects of the infrastructure that was built to accommodate it are still being felt[^log].

[^log]: On [a log scale](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fWLSwxN2yEvHTBQIYaj3sqYjwNiKRDDLLd4VoZsh29Q/pubchart?oid=431477203&format=interactive) this line is almost perfectly straight. An example of growth that happens exponentially where exponentially means "to the power of 2" and not "very fast".

This is a combination of the [Birmingham historic population data from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Birmingham#Historic_population) and data from B.R. Mitchel, <cite>International Historical Statistics: Europe, 1750&ndash;1988</cite>, Stockton Press, Third Edition, From [Slide 90](http://slideplayer.com/slide/9253651/).

The industrial revolution happened over about a century, and it was still extremely disruptive. If the change in labour markets is coming as fast as everyone seems to expect then it’s going to be at least twice as fast. If we use driverless cars&mdash;everyone's favourite&mdash;as an example. In 40 years time there will be almost no driving jobs[^2]. USA population is 319 million, of that 1.4 million are truck drivers. That's only half a percent, _but_ truck driving is still able to be the most common job in [almost every state](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/05/382664837/map-the-most-common-job-in-every-state). This is only _truck_ driving, many more jobs are heavily driving based even if that's not the real focus of the job.

This is what I wanted to get onto! If you are a community nurse who sees patients in a spread out area, then you don't have a driving job, but you _do_ have some driving component to your job. This is a task that you need to do, and you'll probably be very pleased not to need to do it any more. You can sit in the driverless car and write up your notes, prepare for the next patient. You will therefore be able to do a better job of your job.

This is the optimist situation. That time can't be reclaimed easily (unless you do phone consultations to prep patients on your way to them) so it's unlikely that you'll be 'automated away'.

Most jobs, the automation aspect is more subtle. Let's say that a group of 100 people working on a lettuce farm can pick 1000 lettuces each a day. Let's mess with the market a bit so that we know that the supermarket wants to buy exactly 100 000 every day. If everyone worked an extra 4.8 minutes each day it'd be the same as adding an extra person to the team. If we find a way to make their knives[^5] a bit sharper making each of them 1% faster, that has the same effect. Because the market only demands 100 000 units a day, not 101 000 the farm now only needs 99 people.

This is a bit of a silly, toy example but I'm trying to show that jobs aren't actually a thing. They exist to wrap a collection of tasks. Jobs aren't automatable, but tasks are. Sometimes jobs consist of only one task, like the person <q>inefficient[ly]... bagging French fries</q>[^6], so they are easy to conflate with _job_ automation, but most jobs aren't so straightforward.

This post is supposed to be a fairly quick one and I've already gone on too long already. Having said all that, you're ready to read this from the [Las Vegas Sun - Can virtual reality threaten the brothel industry?](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2016/jun/06/can-virtual-reality-threaten-the-brothel-industry/).

VR can't take a big bite out of brothel's business, but it can nibble away at it until they start to notice. (At least until a big jump in teledildonics technology!)

[^1]: I was a bit conflicted about using this word, but [Wikipedia seems to back me up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalence) <q>ambivalence is the experience of having an attitude towards someone or something that contains both positively and negatively valenced components</q>. _Agnostic_ would be the fashionable way to say it, but that's more about being unknowable. 

[^2]: 20 years[^3] seems to be the generally accepted, safe bet-[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/13/self-driving-cars-bmw-google-2020-driving), [Business insider quoting KPMG](http://www.businessinsider.com/report-10-million-self-driving-cars-will-be-on-the-road-by-2020-2015-5-6), but Google is more optimistic. If we're extremely conservative about it and we assume that the halflife of the existing fleet is 20 years[^4] then there will still be almost nobody driving themselves by then.

[^3]: Although 20 years is also the magic number that is always quoted by AI people. Long enough that they'll probably be retired by the time 20 years comes around.

[^4]: It's extremely unlikely that this will be the case. The negative externalities caused by human drivers will almost certainly force them off the roads soon after broad release of driverless cars.
