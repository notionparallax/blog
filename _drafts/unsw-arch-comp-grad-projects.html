<div style="font-size: 1px; color: #ffffff;">If you are reading this on Facebook then <a href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/09/unsw-arch-comp-grad-projects/">click here</a> to go to the civilised version, out there in the wild wild west of the internets; it looks nicer.</div>
<p>UNSW's Arch comp course students need to find a 'real' client for their final project. I <a title="New research student" href="http://www.notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/2011/05/new-research-student/">mentioned before</a> that I had one student, but now I'm lucky enough to be supervising three this semester!</p>
<p>They are <a title="Arch Comp Project blog" href="http://bvnunsw.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/update-progress/">chronicling their work here</a>, but the general gist of things is that Jen is doing AR, Mike is doing caves, and Jay is doing Kinnect UIs. I've explained their work in terms of the technology that they are using, which is exactly what I've asked them to do! I've asked them to frame their research in terms of an architectural question that they can try to answer by using a technological approach. I've also asked for some kind of empirical metric of efficacy for this approach vs the status quo.</p>
