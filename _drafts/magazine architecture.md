## CHAPTER 5

# Magazine Architecture: No Road

Most buildings have neither High Road nor Low Road virtues. Instead they strenuously avoid any relationship whatever and what is considered its depredation. The very worst are famous new buildings, would-be famous buildings, imitation s buildings, and imitation imitation buildings. Whatever the error is, it is catching. 

I first came to this question&mdash;and to this book&mdash;through experience with a building whose fame, as usual, is the fame of its architect. I. M. Pei was considered by a 1991 poll of the American Institute of Architects to be the most influential living American architect." Designer of the glass pyramid and renovation for the Louvre in Paris and of a spectacular skyscraper in Hong Kong, his reputation is worldwide. The MIT campus in Massachusetts considers itself lucky to have three buildings designed by Pei, who was once a student there. In 1986 his third MIT building, known informally as the Media Lab and formally as the Wiesner Building, had just opened when I joined the Media Lab for a season as a visiting scientist. What I have to say about the building does not reflect on the people or the activities of the Media Laboratory itself, which I enjoyed so much I wrote a book about them.[^1] 

It may have been my familiarity with MIT's homely, accommodating Building 20 just across the street that made the $45 million pretentiousness, ill-functionality, and non-adaptability of the Media Lab building so shocking to me. Here was a building purpose-built to house a diverse array of disciplines and people collaborating on deep research in fast-evolving computer and communication technologies. Consider in that light the building's dominant feature-its vast, sterile atrium. In many research buildings a central atrium serves to bring people together with open stairways, casual meeting areas, and a shared entrance where everyone sees each other daily. The Media Lab's atrium cuts people off from each other. There are three widely separated entrances (each huge and glassy), three elevators, few stairs, and from nowhere can you see other humans in the five-story-high space. Where people might be visible, they are carefully obscured by internal windows of smoked glass.  

The atrium uses up so much of the building that actual working office and lab space is severely limited, making growth and new programs nearly impossible and exacerbating academic turf battles from the first day. Nowhere in the whole building is there a place for casual meetings, except for a tiny, overused kitchen. Corridors are narrow and barren. Getting new cabling through the interior concrete walls&mdash;a necessity in such a laboratory&mdash;requires bringing in jackhammers. You can't even move office walls around, thanks to the overhead fluorescent lights being at a Pei-signature 45-degree angle to everything else.[^2]

The Media Lab building, I discovered, is not unusually bad. Its badness is the norm in new buildings over designed by architects. How did architects come to be such an obstacle to adaptivity in buildings? That's a central question not just for building users but for the architectural profession, which regards itself these years as being in crisis. Design professor C. Thomas Mitchell voices a common indictment:

> A range of observers of architecture are now suggesting that the field may be bankrupt, the profession itself impotent, and the methods inapplicable to contemporary design tasks. It is further suggested that collectively they are incapable of producing pleasant, livable, and humane environments, except perhaps occasionally and then only by chance.[^3]

1990 Blessed with not one but two echoing lobbies, the Wiesner Building's only cordial staircase links them. Foot traffic in all the working part of the building is forced to use depressing, hidden, concrete fire stairs. Researchers who are meant to collaborate across disciplines can go for weeks in the building without ever seeing each other casually. Desperate for more office and lab space, the Media Lab is considering tunnelling under the adjoining plaza.

1990 - Occupied in 1985, MIT Wiesner Building houses art galleries on the ground floor and The Media Laboratory in the basement and top three floors. The design of more convivial research buildings is not a mystery-see p. 172 (Mathematical Sciences Research Institute), p. 176 (MIT's own Main Building) and p. 180 (Princeton's Molecular Biology Laboratory).

<p class="big-caption">IMPRESSIVE AND USELESS, the massive atrium in I. M. Pei's Wiesner Building at MIT hogs space, isolates and overwhelms people, and provides no amenities. It was meant to be a work of art, a continuation of the building's starkly Modernist skin (right) into the interior. The three balconies at upper left that look like truncated freeway exits serve no function whatever. The smoked-glass interior windows at upper right ensure that humans remain invisible in the space. The design may be alienating, but it's expensive.</p>

At the risk of sounding like yet another architect-basher, let me take a stab at diagnosis.

Marvin Minsky, one of the founders of Artificial Intelligence, was gazing across the deserted Media Lab atrium with me one day.  The problem with architects," he rasped, "is they think they're artists, and they're not very competent."

Sure enough, if you look at the history of architecture as a profession, it was always around distinctions of art that architects distinguished themselves from mere builders"&mdash;starting in the mid-19th century, when the profession emerged, and continuing to the present day.[^4] "Art-and-Architecture" are always clumped together. What's wrong with that? Few modern artists approve of anything static. Artistic architects should be the most accepting of all of interactivity with their audience.

The problems of art as architectural aspiration come down to these:

* Art is proudly non-functional and impractical. 
* Art reveres the new and despises the conventional. 
* Architectural art sells at a distance.

Architect Peter Calthorpe maintains that many of the follies of his profession would vanish if architects simply decided that what they do is craft instead of art. The distinction is fundamental, according to folklorist Henry Glassie: "If a pleasure-giving function predominates, the artifact is called art: if a practical function predominates, it is called craft. Craft is something useful made _with_ artfulness, with close attention to detail should buildings be. 

Art must be inherently radical, but buildings are inherently conservative. Art must experiment to do its job. Most experiments fail Art costs extra. How much extra are you will to pay to live in a failed experiment? Art flouts convention Convention became conventional because it works. Aspiring to art means aspiring to a building that almost certainly cannot because the old good solutions are thrown away. The roof has dramatic new look, and it leaks dramatically.  

Art begets fashion; fashion means style; style is made of illusion (granite veneer pretending to be solid; facade columns pretending to hold up something); and illusion is no friend to function. The fashion game is fun for architects to play and diverting for the public to watch, but it's deadly for building users. When the height of fashion moves on, they're the ones left behind, stuck in a building that was designed to look good rather than work well. and now it doesn't even look good. They spend their day trapped in someone else's taste, which everyone now agrees is bad taste Here, time becomes a problem for buildings. Fashion can only advance by punishing the no-longer-fashionable. Formerly stylish clothing you can throw or give away, a building goes on looking ever more out-of-it, decade after decade, until a new skin is grafted on at great expense, and the cycle begins again&mdash;months of glory, years of shame.

A major culprit is architectural photography, according to a group of Architecture Department faculty I had lunch with at the University of California, Berkeley. Clare Cooper Marcus said it most clearly: "You get work through getting awards, and the award system is based on photographs. Not use. Not context. Just purely visual photographs taken before people start using the building." Tales were told of ambitious architects specifically performing well designing their buildings to photograph well at the expense of performing well.

I heard something similar from San Francisco architect Herb Mclaughlin: "Awards never reflect functionality. I remember serving on a jury one time and suggesting, 'Okay, we've winnowed this down to ten projects that we really like. Let's call the clients and see how they feel about the buildings, because I don't want to give an award to a building that doesn't work. I was hooted down by my fellow architects." In London, architect Frank Duffy fumed to me about the curse of architectural photography, which is all about the wonderfully composed shot, the absolutely lifeless picture that takes time out of architecture&mdash;the photograph taken the day before move-in. That's what you get awards for, that's what you make a career based on. All those lovely but empty stills of uninhabited and uninhabitable spaces have squeezed more life out of architecture than perhaps any other single factor."

At a building preservation conference in Charleston, South Carolina, I chatted with an architecture student. Interested primarily in rehab and restoration work, she referred unflatteringly to the majority of her 450 fellow students at the Tulane University Architecture Department as "magazine architects." By which she meant image-driven and fad-driven architecture, because architecture magazines probe no deeper than the look and style of the buildings they cover. They never interview clients or users. They never criticize buildings except, rarely, in terms of being bad art or off-trend. Articles consist primarily of stylized color photographs. Reports cover only new or newly renovated buildings, often in language that sounds like the prismatic luminescence" school of wine writing. The subject is taste, not use; commercial success, not operational success. Architecture magazines are about what sells. They are advertising, cover to cover.

The illusion of perfectly dressed stone was incised in stucco over very well-dressed genuine stone at the Classical Greek stadium (4th century B.C.) at Arycanda in modern Turkey. Through the ages, style-conscious building designers have preferred _faux_ materials to the real thing. Early Modernist theory sneered at such fakery, but later Modernist architects were eager to clad their boxes with phoney veneers.</p>

Architecture, being art, is supposed to have movements. In the customary sequence, a movement starts in relevance, loses it but prospers anyway for many years, then succumbs to the next cycle. Modernism began in the 1890s with the arrival of whole new _kinds_ of buildings-factories, department stores, high rises. Form, stuck for precedent, followed function. Then that insight was aestheticized (and anesthetized) by the Bauhaus movement in the 1920s and 1930s, and its teachers migrated to America to avoid Hitler. So matters stood when all of America and Europe needed new buildings after the war-America to express its new prowess and prosperity, Europe to replace its devastated cities. Modernism got renamed the International Style ("because no one wanted to claim it," says Boston city planner Stephen Coyle), and suddenly all the world's major cities began to look the same. Being minimalist on principle, Modernist buildings could be built cheap but showy. Less money for construction, more glory for the architect. Everybody won but the users.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, architecture departments on a few campuses such as MIT, Berkeley, and London's Architectural Association fomented a revolution in response to the painfully evident failures of Modernism. Teachers began to talk of the need for "loose fit" in designing buildings, so that unexpected uses of the building could be accommodate[^6] "Post-Occupancy Evaluation" was invented and became a subdiscipline. Chris Alexander and colleagues came up with their "pattern language" of design elements that wear well. The rapid growth of services such as air-conditioning led to more systemic study of buildings and their uses. Conserving energy became a source of design innovation. Even the psychology of building use was explored. Then it all faded. What happened?

Art fought back. In 1966 the Museum of Modern Art had published a book by architect Robert Venturi titled _Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture_. It attacked the puritanical simplicity of Modernism&mdash;"I am for messy vitality over obvious unity." In 1972 Venturi aesthetically interpreted a commercial event&mdash;the gaudy success in Las Vegas of what he called decorated sheds." The insight was perfect. Now architects could celebrate the corner they had been backed into by the fragmentation of the building trades, and be exterior decorators solely and proudly. I don't fault Venturi; I admire his buildings and writings. It was the leadership of the profession that took the easy path away from complex responsibility and back to airy debate about style.

By the 1980s, "Post-Modernism" had swept the architecture departments and the rising partnerships. "Historicism&mdash;casual looting of historic styles&mdash;took off, and Palladian half-circles triangular gable ends and toy-like cheery colors bedizened the land. To their credit, Postmodern buildings were general

    A standard line among potters is: "If it holds water, it's craft. If it leaks it's art."
