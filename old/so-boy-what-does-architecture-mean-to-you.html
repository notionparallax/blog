    I wrote this in May, but I withdrew it following the advice of a very good
    friend that it wasn't very well written, which almost certainly translates
    to "not very well thought out"! Maybe this version is a little better."

    This will almost certainly upset a lot of people. It ties in with the
    thinking that leads me to some of my (slightly rushed) comments here about

        href="https://notionparallax.co.uk/2010/architects-pay"
        >architects' pay</a
    >, and about my general feeling about our collective view of our profession
    and our professional identity.

    I've often heard people telling tales of being asked by a seasoned
    practitioner "<em>so what does architecture mean to you</em>", on their
    first day in an office. The usual answer is something like Grasshopper gives
    at the beginning of kung fu, either something naive or something lifted from
    a book without too much thought because it sounds good.
</p>
<p>
    I've been thinking about this question for a long time because none of the
    answers I've ever heard were particularly satisfactory. Nothing was simple
    enough to be comprehensible, nor complete enough to be satisfactory; which
    has lead me to having a crack at defining what it means <em>to me</em>.

    >If you were to ask people what was in this photo, just general people who
    were walking past, you'd probably get a number of different responses, but I
    bet you that the top five would have: Sydney, buildings, architecture and
    skyline amongst it somewhere.

    >If we were to try the same test on the same bunch of general punters then
    you might get blood, bear, children, medicine, but you almost certainly
    wouldn't get industrial design or product design. This thought experiment
    leads me to one of the emerging themes in my moaning about the world;
    failure of definitions. (I've got a few more posts in the pipeline about
    that, but it relies on my motivation...)
</p>
<p>
    Architecture is both a noun and a verb, and whilst I'm happy with the
    general public using it both ways, I feel that as a body of professionals we
    ought to be specific in how we apply it. This is my attempt to be specific.

    >In my formulation of a rough meaning, the skyline shot above is composed of
    <em>buildings</em>. There are just too many different disciplines involved
    in the creation of any building much bigger than a garden shed to call it
    architecture. Doing so indicates a horrific level of arrogance and
    disrespect for non-architect contributors to the project.
</p>
<p>
    It would seem odd to refer to the skyline as a photo of structural
    engineering, town planning, politics, concrete mixing or contract writing.
    Yet they are all constituent parts of the huge team that was responsible for
    that skyline coming into existence. So why should architecture be privileged
    above all others? This is a question that I don't feel I'm in a position to
    answer, there is too much history, and I'm
    <a
        title="I'm not sure I'll even not feel too young to answer this kind of question!"
        ><em>still</em></a
    >
    too young to make any sort of attempt that won't just come across as naïve.
</p>
<p>
    I think that architecture is a <em>process</em>; a verb. I don't think that
    too many people would disagree that when someone who self-identifies as 'an
    architect' goes to work, they <em>do</em> things that they would identify as
    'architecture'. I see architecture (verb) to be an organisational role; the
    task of martialling and synthesising large quantities of information to
    resolve (often conflicting) constraints. The resolution of those
    constraints is the product of the process of architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The debate about protection of function and the less onerous, but just as
    hotly contested one on protection of title has often poked an angry stick at
    '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect"
        >software architects</a
    >' as being some sort of joke profession, stealing the title
    <em>architect</em> as a way to make them sound sexier or more respectable.
    What they do is conceptually very closely aligned with the role that I think
    that architects do. They also need resolve complex networks of
    interdependent constraints and, like (building) architects, their product is
    a design that is then brought to the end user by a proxy; the software
    engineer (or in the built environment, the builder).
</p>
<p>
    I think that this is a fairly simple concept, and I hope it won't result in
    my excommunication from too many circles. So to summarise:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Architecture is a verb, not a noun.</li>
    <li>
        There is no such thing as a piece of architecture, simply a product that
        is the outcome of a process that architecture was performed during its
        inception.
    </li>
    <li>
        As architecture is a process, its bounds are not limited to the built
        environment. Any area that the application of these skills would be
        beneficial could just as validly use the process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This seems pretty simple to me, but it has some implications for the
    protection of name argument that I don't really want to get into, but to put
    them to bed before they get out of control, I think that there needs to be
    more made of affiliation to a professional body rather than reliance on an
    international word to describe why someone ought to hire you or someone of
    your tribe, and not anyone from different tribe, or heaven forbid a member
    of no tribe at all.
