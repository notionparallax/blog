                Why is bullshit so common in some organizations? Existing
                explanations focus on the characteristics of bullshitters, the
                nature of the audience, and social structural factors which
                encourage bullshitting. In this paper, I offer an alternative
                explanation: bullshitting is a social practice that
                organizational members engage with to become part of a speech
                community, to get things done in that community, and to
                reinforce their identity. When the practice of bullshitting
                works, it can gradually expand from a small group to take over
                an entire organization and industry. When bullshitting
                backfires, previously sacred concepts can become seen as empty
                and misleading talk.

                When Anna Weiner moved from a New York publisher to a Silicon
                Valley start-up, she was stunned by the way people spoke. The
                technology firm she worked for hired ‘a man who spoke in
                inscrutable jargon and maintained a robust fleet of social media
                accounts: He had thousands of followers and behaved as if he was
                an influencer. He was constantly changing job titles on a
                website where people voluntarily post their resumes, giving
                himself promotions to positions that did not exist’ (<a

                scooter into the office and rolled about barking into a wireless
                headset about growth hacking:

                >
                ‘It was garbage language to my ears’, Weiner writes, ‘but the
                customers loved him. I couldn’t believe it worked’ (ibid).
            </p>
            <p>
                The ‘garbage language’ Weiner stumbled on is not unique to
                Silicon Valley. Organizations in many industries are infused
                with similar language. The ex-<i>Financial Times</i> journalist
                Lucy Kellaway collected up some examples in her ‘guffopedia’.
                They include ‘chief pollinator’, ‘iconicity’ and ‘loincloth
                strategy’.

                    >Graeber, 2018</a
                >), In this paper, I claim bullshitting is a social practice. I
                will argue that in particular speech communities people are
                encouraged to play the language game of bullshitting, and when
                it is played well it can bolster their identity. Under certain
                conditions, bullshitting is relatively harmless and can even be
                beneficial. But bullshitting can quickly spiral out of control
                and take over an entire organization or industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will argue that bullshitting is triggered by a speech
                community with many conceptual entrepreneurs, significant
                amounts of noisy ignorance and permissive uncertainty. These
                conditions are likely to spark the language game of
                bullshitting. This entails people articulating empty and
                misleading statements that are processed in a shallow way and
                lead to surface-level agreement. When this game works, it can
                enhance the image and identity of players. If this happens, they
                are likely to engage in further rounds of bullshitting and
                reinvest in the speech community which perpetuates bullshitting.
                When the game backfires, it can undermine the players’ identity
                and image. This makes them less likely to want to play the
                bullshit game again and reinvest in the speech community which
                encourages bullshitting. When bullshitting reinforces players’
                image and identity, it increases the scale and scope of
                bullshitting. As a consequence, bullshitting can evolve from
                being informal interaction into a routine practice, a formalized
                procedure and even a sacred ritual. When bullshitting misfires,
                it can be undermined. This can mean that what were previously
                seen as sacred statements end up being viewed as bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make this argument, I proceed as follows. First, I outline
                the evolving history of the concept of bullshit. After
                considering existing explanations of bullshit, I make the case
                for seeing bullshit as a social practice. I develop a model of
                how the social practice of bullshitting works in organizations.
                In the discussion, I chart how bullshitting can either scale up
                or be undermined. In the conclusion, I draw out some of the
                implications of this analysis, the limitations of my argument
                and lines for future research which it opens up.

            <p>
                According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, bullshit is an
                informal vulgar term which means ‘to talk nonsense, especially
                with the intent of misleading or deceiving’. The Oxford English
                Dictionary defines bullshit as ‘to talk nonsense or rubbish’ and
                ‘to bluff one’s way through something by talking nonsense’. The
                word is rooted in ‘bull’ which has been used from the 17th
                century onwards to mean nonsense. This in turns derives from the
                Old French term <i>bole</i> which means fraud and deceit.

                >). Australian and New Zealand troops mocked British officers by
                calling it ‘bullshit’. Partridge suggests the term became common
                in military life during World War II. Throughout this period, it
                was used to refer to excessive regimentalism and attention to
                appearances. For instance, if soldiers prepared their quarters
                for inspection by a commanding officer, they engaged in
                ‘bullshit’. Partridge gives the following example: ‘We’ve got to
                get this place bullshitted up—the Commanding Officer is coming
                around tomorrow morning.’ The troops used the term ‘bullshat’ to
                refer to something which has been polished up for display
                purposes. For instance, ‘Don’t touch that, it’s just been
                bullshat!’ ‘Bullshit’ was also closely connected with high-level
                administration. For instance, during World War II, New Zealand
                airmen referred to the air-force headquarters as the ‘bullshit
                castle’.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term bullshit entered into print during World War II. The
                first instance of the word recorded by the Oxford English
                Dictionary is in a dictionary of North American slang published
                in 1942. A Google n-gram search shows a rapid growth in the use
                of the word in published sources from the early 1960s onwards.
                But it was only in 1986 that the term received a detailed
                philosophical treatment. In an article originally printed in a
                specialist journal in 1986 then republished as a book in 2005,
                Harry Frankfurt set about defining bullshit. While lying is an
                attempt to conceal the truth (<a

                    >Bok, 1978</a
                >), bullshit is to talk without reference to the truth. ‘It is
                just this lack of connection to a concern with truth – this
                indifference to how things really are – that I regard as the
                essence of bullshit’, Frankfurt writes (p. 33). Underpinning
                this is a ‘motive guiding and controlling’ the bullshitter
                meaning they are ‘unconcerned with how the things about which he
                speaks truly are’ (p. 55). To illustrate this, Frankfurt
                recounts an encounter between the philosopher Ludwig
                Wittgenstein and his friend and Russian teacher, Fania Pascal.
                While Pascal was convalescing in hospital after having her
                tonsils removed, she received a call from Wittgenstein. Pascal
                said ‘I feel like a dog that has been run over.’ Wittgenstein
                told his friend ‘You don’t know what a dog that has been run
                over feels like.’ Although the philosopher’s response is
                unfriendly in the extreme, it does make a logical point.
                Strictly speaking, a human can’t know what a run-over dog feels
                like.

                trousers’ (p. 324). Instead of focusing on the bullshitter’s
                intentions, he argues, we should look at the structure of
                bullshit. Cohen goes on to identify ‘unclarifiable unclarity’ as
                the key feature of bullshit (p. 333). These are statements which
                are unclear (‘unclarity’) but for which there are no procedures
                to make it clear (‘unclarifiable’). A bullshit statement is ‘not
                only obscure but cannot be rendered unobscured’. Furthermore,
                ‘any apparent success in rendering it unobscured secretes
                something that isn’t recognizable as a version of what was said’
                (p. 332). To illustrate this point, Cohen returns to his days as
                an earnest young PhD student obsessed with the writings of the
                French Marxist, Louis Althusser. He explains how he found ‘the
                material hard to understand’, and when he did ‘extract what
                seemed like a reasonable idea from one of their texts, I
                attributed it more interest or more importance . . . than it
                had’. His struggle to understand the texts and his subsequent
                use of this Althusserian language was not driven by a desire to
                mislead, but by the inherent ‘unclarifiable unclarity’ of the
                French philosopher’s texts.

                Frankfurt and Cohen’s papers have inspired a growing field of
                ‘bullshitology’. Much of this research broadly accepts the
                insights in both papers, but points out that there is need to
                look at bullshitting as a form of communication. This means
                understanding the interactions between bullshitters, the
                language of bullshit and audience (<a

                <i>empty and misleading communication</i>. A more substantive
                definition of bullshit is that it consists of evasive and/or
                persuasive communication involving an indifference to the truth
                or attempts to pursue the truth which are driven by
                epistemically maligned intentions.

                Before examining the underlying structure of bullshit, it is
                worth pausing to point out the differences between bullshit and
                other similar concepts. Bullshit is frequently differentiated
                from lying. A lie is a statement which the liar believes to be
                false but they present as if it is true, often with intentions
                of deceit (<a

                and the intention behind it is not always outright deception.

                who argues that a liar is concerned about the truth, but
                attempts to replace it with falsehood. In contrast, the
                bullshitter is unconcerned with the truth and speaks with no
                reference to it. The bullshitter falls short of lying because
                they make use of insincere and misleading statements rather than
                outright falsehoods. Recent psychological work has found that
                established measures of everyday lying are sufficiently distinct

                A second concept which is relatively close to bullshit is
                jargon. Jargon is technical language which is often tied to
                prestigious bodies of knowledge such as science, the arts and
                religion. It helps the speaker to be precise and communicate
                ideas quickly with other initiates, but it also hampers
                communication with the non-initiated (<a

                highly meaningful and sensible to insiders. It is also loaded
                with its own logic, empirical references and it is at least
                potentially decipherable. Finally, jargon is not typically used
                to mislead members of the community. Rather, it is used to
                communicate things which are meaningful within that community.
                It is worth noting that jargon can be used to mislead or confuse
                people who are not initiates in the community originating the
                jargon (<a

                A third type of language which is similar to bullshit is the
                ambiguous statement. This might seem empty because it is
                difficult to define and can be attributed with multiple meanings

                they can refer to a very wide range of things. Ambiguous
                statements might be maddening to the precise mind of an analytic
                philosopher, but they are a characteristic part of everyday
                life. For instance, managers use ambiguous concepts as part of
                their day-to-day work (<a

                have malign intentions to mislead or deceive others. Managers
                can use ambiguity to facilitate action, create agreement between
                conflicting factions, open up ground for exploration and
                discovery, or simply fill in a conversation (<a

                acknowledges ambiguous statements can generate novel social,
                cognitive or aesthetic experience. However, ambiguous statements
                which are used to mislead or deceive are more properly
                identified as ‘bullshit’.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a final type of statement which should not be strictly
                considered to be bullshit. These are statements which are empty
                and misleading but do not entail communication. The idea of an
                uncommunicated statement may seem like an oxymoron. For
                something to be a statement or claim, it needs to be
                communicated with another person. Perhaps the closest we might
                get to uncommunicated empty and misleading claims is
                ‘bullshitting ourselves’. This is when we engage in empty and
                misleading self-talk. For instance, a would-be entrepreneur
                might mislead themselves into believing their venture will
                inevitably succeed. Such self-bullshitting could foster the
                well-documented effect of naïve optimism among entrepreneurs (<a

                shared linguistic categories. This means it is a kind of
                self-communication or ‘internal conversation’ (<a

                be meaningfully thought about as a specific form of bullshit:
                self-bullshit. Indeed, psychologists have found that more
                frequent bullshitters were also likely to engage in
                significantly more self-enhancement behaviours (<a

                Having defined what bullshit is, and what it is not, we can move
                on to ask why bullshit exists. In the small but growing
                interdisciplinary field of bullshitology, there are four types
                of explanation: speaker-focused, audience-focused,
                social-structural and social practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most intuitive explanation for why bullshit exists is the
                individual bullshitter. Many philosophical accounts assume that
                particular individuals have questionable motives or moral flaws
                which predispose them to bullshitting. For instance, Frankfurt
                points towards questionable motives of bullshitters such as
                intention to mislead their audience for personal gain (<a

                less honest, less open-minded, have lower feelings of self-worth

                Focusing on the characteristics of a bullshitter does not
                explain why some people are willing to accept misleading and
                empty claims. This paucity has led a group of psychologists to
                offer a second way of explaining the existence of bullshit. They
                have shifted attention from the characteristics of the
                bullshitter to the characteristics of the audience. There is
                long stream of work in cognitive and developmental psychology
                which shows that most people are not particularly good at
                spotting deceptive or misleading statements (<a

                grandiose branding campaigns. In my own book on the topic, I

                theoretical account. Drawing on studies of social epistemology,
                he argues that we gain most of our knowledge second hand. This
                means that we do not do epistemic due diligence ourselves. We
                are usually not cognitively equipped to do such due diligence,
                and even when we are, it is exhausting for us and alienating for
                others. Furthermore, in most social settings there is not one
                obvious correct answer waiting to be found (<a

                we rely upon social cues to sort out which knowledge claims are
                true and which are false. These include the characteristics of
                the person speaking, the background knowledge that people draw
                on, and the interactional dynamics between parties. Often our
                reliance upon social cues means we systematically relax our
                epistemic norms to deal with ‘the social pragmatic need to get

                study of a large American corporation. He found that
                bullshitting was systematically expected of middle managers in
                the company. One informant told Jackall that his job involved
                ‘characterizing the reality of a situation with
                <i>any</i> description that is necessary to make that situation
                more palatable to some group that matters . . . Everyone knows

                little bullshit, and also being able to judge the appropriate
                moment to bullshit. Competent bullshitters also needed to become
                competent audience members for performances of bullshit. They
                had to learn that bullshit should not be taken too seriously and
                it should be engaged with in just the right way. If you took
                bullshit too seriously, you ran the risk of being seen as a
                chump. Likewise, if you challenged bullshit too frequently, you
                risked being seen as an asshole.

                A second example of the social practice of bullshitting at work
                can be found in a study of health and safety practices in the

                >). They found that many of the onshore agencies were adept
                users of the language of ‘resilience’. The researchers noticed
                that onshore staff such as managers from a large oil company and
                government officials were adept at speaking at length about
                resilience, but rarely would they be specific about what they
                actually meant. This meant the concept was essentially
                ‘unclarifiable’ and could be applied to almost any aspects of
                the shipping operation. The offshore operational staff were
                skeptical and indifferent about ‘resilence’. The offshore staff
                could talk about resilience when they were expected to (for
                instance, when a safety inspector arrived), but they didn’t
                seriously believe in it. One ship captain described resilience
                talk as ‘toilet paper’ which he only used to ‘cover my arse’.
                Offshore operatives used the language of resilience as a kind of
                game they were expected to play if they wanted to legitimate
                their work in the eyes of distant bureaucratic bodies who would
                infrequently take an interest in them. They needed to play the
                bullshit game if they wanted to keep the authorities off their
                back.

                shifts, Sausdal noticed that they would occasionally talk in
                crude and violent terms. They talked about prisoners as ‘filthy
                animals’, laughed about the bombing of a foreign village,
                ignored the desecration of a cemetery and discussed crushing the
                skull of a suspect. Sausdal was confused. This kind of
                disturbing talk stood in stark opposition to the routine and
                dutiful behaviours of the officers he had observed. Over time,
                he realized that this kind of talk was best thought of as
                bullshit. It was ‘mean yet meaningless’ (<a

                    >Sausdal, 2020</a
                >, p. 96). He realized this talk was bullshit which wasn’t
                supposed to mean anything substantive. They were often ‘saying
                stupid things just for the sake of saying stupid things –
                bullshitting for the sake of bullshitting’ (p. 104). Officers
                saw it as way of ‘stirring things up’ during a tedious shift.
                They relied on the fact that fellow police officers clearly knew
                when one of their number was bullshitting. They also knew that
                these crude and violent outbursts were fantasies (which they
                usually didn’t find that appealing). One police officer
                explained that ‘We are obviously being obscene when saying stuff
                like that. And, yes, we know it’s tasteless, but that’s the
                point really. Besides that, there’s often no real point to it’
                (p. 107). In short, bullshitting was a way to pass the time –
                but it was also a way to be part of the informal culture of the
                police force.

                In this paper, I will build on the idea that bullshitting is a
                social practice. In particular, I will develop the idea that
                some speech communities encourage the language game of
                bullshitting. By playing this language game, people can support
                (or in some cases undermine) their image and identity. This in
                turn can give rise to vicious or virtuous circles of
                bullshitting. I will argue that speech communities tend to
                encourage bullshitting when they have three characteristics:
                they are occupied by many conceptual entrepreneurs (who create a
                plentiful supply of bullshit), there is noisy ignorance (which
                creates a demand for bullshit) and there is permissive
                uncertainty (which creates an opportunity for bullshitting).
                Such speech communities give rise to the language game of
                bullshitting. This entails participants articulating misleading
                statements, processing them in a shallow way in order to
                maintain a sense of surface-level agreement between the players.
                When this game works smoothly, it can enhance the image and
                identity of the players. This often leads them to continue
                playing the bullshit game. It also reinforces the speech
                community which supports the game. However, when the game of
                bullshitting misfires, it can undermine the image and identity
                of players. If this happens, people are less likely to continue
                playing the game and are less likely to continue investing in
                the speech community (see

                    out group membership. Becoming part of that group means
                    learning new ways of speaking. Gumperz pointed out that

                    In the contexts of organizations, becoming part of the
                    speech community of middle management means learning a set
                    of ‘elaborate linguistic etiquette and stylistic
                    conventions’. Often that means learning how to bullshit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within a particular speech community, there are three core
                    components which are likely to make bullshit more prevalent:
                    <i>conceptual entrepreneurs, noisy ignorance</i> and
                    <i>permissive uncertainty</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first characteristic of the speech community which is
                    conducive to bullshitting is a large number of potential
                    suppliers of bullshit. One important source of supply are
                    <i>conceptual entrepreneurs</i>. These are actors with a
                    stock of pre-packaged concepts they try to market to others.
                    Many conceptual entrepreneurs operate in the management
                    ideas industry. This is a sector made up of consultants,
                    gurus, thought leaders, publishers and some academics (<a

                    >). The quality of actors operating in this industry tends
                    to be extremely variable. A consequence is that some of the
                    conceptual entrepreneurs seeking to peddle their wares in
                    the management ideas industry are bullshit merchants. There
                    are some sub-sectors of the management ideas industry where
                    bullshit merchants are particularly concentrated. One is the

                    followed a cohort of students at a mid-ranked North American
                    university as they joined a campus-based business
                    accelerator. Many put their lives on hold to launch
                    start-ups. When these eventually failed, they often found
                    themselves struggling to re-enter the mainstream labour
                    market. They also tried to grapple with the ultimately
                    meaningless and misleading advice about entrepreneurship
                    they were exposed to during their time in the accelerator.

                    A second aspect of a speech community which can foster
                    bullshitting is <i>noisy ignorance</i>. This is when actors
                    lack knowledge about an issue yet still feel compelled to
                    talk about it. It is not just the result of a lack of
                    cognitive ability (however, it could be;

                    understanding or experience concerning the issues being
                    discussed. Often that ignorance has been strategically
                    cultivated (<a

                    information or knowledge about an issue. In other cases,
                    noisy ignorance is created by knowledge asymmetries where
                    one party knows much more about a particular issue than
                    another. When an actor is relatively ignorant about an
                    issue, they do not have the wider background knowledge in
                    order to compare new claims. Nor do they have an
                    understanding of the right questions they might ask. This
                    means they rely on relatively crude understandings of an
                    issue yet tend to be much more certain than an expert would

                    When ignorance is <i>noisy</i>, uninformed actors do not
                    simply stay silent about what they don’t know. Rather, they
                    are compelled to speak about an issue of which they have
                    little knowledge or understanding. A recent experimental
                    study found that this compulsion to speak (coupled with a
                    lack of accountability created by a ‘social pass’) was an
                    important factor in explaining bullshitting (<a

                    instance, middle managers are often relatively ignorant
                    about the work their subordinates are engaged with, but are
                    under pressure to act as the leader by doing or say

                    engage with the people they manage in language they find
                    meaningful. A second example is British government ministers
                    who find themselves with a new policy portfolio (<a

                    the new policy area, but they are under pressure to say and
                    do something. To address this tricky situation, politicians
                    rely on empty and often misleading language.

                    There also needs to be an opportunity in a speech community
                    to use bullshit. Such an opportunity typically appears when
                    a speech community is infused with
                    <i>permissive uncertainty</i>. This is a situation where
                    actors do not know what will happen and are willing to
                    consider almost any knowledge that might plug this epistemic
                    gap. They face high levels of uncertainty, yet have
                    permissive epistemic norms which guide the problem of
                    sorting out what to do. This creates a curious situation
                    where almost any knowledge claim goes. When faced with a
                    wicked problem such as a significant and unexpected
                    environmental change, some organizations experience high
                    levels of uncertainty but also find that different kinds of
                    experts claim ownership over the problem (<a

                    and drift. Under these circumstances, a greater sense of
                    confusion can well up and an ‘anything goes’ approach takes

                    having imperfect knowledge about the world. Epistemic
                    uncertainty can also be generated by competing and
                    overlapping knowledge claims which create a dense patchwork
                    of contradictory truths, making it difficult for an actor to
                    make a judgement about what they think is correct. In
                    addition, people face ontological uncertainty. This comes
                    from the fact that social reality is ‘inherently risky and

                    reality, that social reality can shift and change. Such

                    the very minimum, as a way of keeping conversation and

                    patterns’. These are similar to the industrial indulgency
                    patterns which entail routine social interactions where an
                    authority figure like a manager allows their subordinates to
                    get away with otherwise banned behaviour (such as stealing
                    materials from a factory) in exchange for compliance (<a

                    when people are willing to indulge weak claims from others
                    in return for indulgence of their own weak claims. When this
                    happens, people begin to allow weak or empty claims to pass
                    without too much scrutiny. If they were to engage in greater
                    epistemological due diligence, then social interaction would
                    become too costly, time-consuming and conflict inducing.
                    These epistemic indulgency patterns allow bullshit to pass
                    without more serious assessment.

                    When such epistemological indulgency patterns are paired
                    with endemic uncertainty, it can create a confusing, yet
                    liberating situation: no-one knows what’s happening and
                    which bodies of knowledge they should draw on to sort things
                    out. For instance, the process of rapid social change in the
                    United States during the late 19th century created a great
                    sense of uncertainty in many people’s lives. It led to the
                    confusing multiplication of forms of knowledge and
                    authority. This uncertainty coupled with a pluralism created
                    an ideal setting where sham commercial ventures and
                    questionable experts peddled their wares. In the medical
                    field, ‘quacks’ (unlicensed doctors) outnumbered licensed
                    doctors by three to one in many parts of the country (<a

                    science. The market for their ‘bullshit’ cures flourished
                    until the early 20th century when legislation reduced the
                    permissiveness associated with medical knowledge claims.
                    Arguably a similar process has occurred in recent years with
                    the rise of new technologies such as artificial
                    intelligence. These new technologies have created a great
                    deal of uncertainty, but they have also enabled some degree
                    of permissiveness around who is able to claim expertise in
                    the technology. This has opened up significant space for
                    bullshitters who talk about artificial intelligence but have
                    little understanding of the underlying technology. This
                    makes it not terribly surprising that a recent analysis of
                    2,830 ‘artificial intelligence’ start-ups in Europe found
                    that about 40 percent of them did not use AI technology at

                    strategies and stakes. Learning how to participate in a
                    language game enables one to make statements which are
                    meaningful in a particular context. The example Wittgenstein
                    gave of a language game is a group of builders communicating
                    with one another. He explains how ‘language is meant to
                    serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant
                    B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks,
                    pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, in the
                    order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a
                    language consisting of the words “block”, “pillar” “slab”,
                    “beam”. A. calls them out; — B brings the stone which he has
                    learnt to bring at such-and-such a call’ (<a

                    >, p. 3). Wittgenstein goes on to explain how these four
                    words (block, pillar, slab, beam) constitute an entire
                    ‘primitive language’ and the builder can get things done by
                    simply saying ‘block there’, ‘slab here’ and so on. Each of
                    these terms (‘block’, ‘slab’ etc.) gains a meaning within
                    the language game. Some of the other examples include
                    forming and testing a hypothesis, making a joke, telling a
                    story, and reporting an event (<a

                    the truth, (2) are driven by misrepresentation of intent and
                    (3) express undue certainty. To bullshit, an actor needs to
                    make an assertion which displays a lack of concern for
                    standards of truth or falsity. In addition, the intent of
                    the statement should be misrepresented. It should not be
                    clearly stated that the person is trying to mislead or not
                    speak with regard to questions of truth or falsehood.
                    Finally, a bullshit statement is typically presented with
                    much more certainty than is warranted. This means that what
                    are often loose conjectures are presented as certainties. An
                    example of this can be found in a study of students at an
                    elite high-school in the United States (<a

                    particular subject, the students often had not put in the
                    required work. To do deal with this tricky situation,
                    students would rely on a few signals of knowledge (such as a
                    few key names or facts). The students would hide their
                    intentions of avoiding scrutiny by feigned fascination with
                    the topic. But most importantly, they would present
                    themselves in an excessively confident manner. They hoped
                    this mixture of conspicuous signals, feigned interest and
                    extreme confidence meant they were able to get through
                    lessons with minimal work. And typically it worked. After
                    leaving, many of the students realized that this ability was
                    the main thing they had learned during their time at the
                    school. It was a skill which stood them in good stead when
                    they took up leadership positions throughout American
                    society.

                    The language game of bullshitting also entails responding to
                    empty assertion. In particular, it involves the
                    <i>shallow processing</i> of empty and misleading claims.
                    This happens when an interlocutor who hears a bullshit claim
                    does not engage in meaningful inquiry through questioning or
                    exploring a claim in more depth (<a

                    response whereby a person faced with a bullshit statement
                    lets it pass without any serious challenge. An example of
                    this is when a senior figure takes the floor in a meeting
                    and makes a series of empty and misleading statements while
                    the audience feigns attention and offers no serious public

                    a more active and affirmative response whereby an actor
                    faced with bullshit responds by joining in. For instance,
                    during interactions with managers spouting the empty and
                    misleading language of leadership, some professionals may
                    respond by ‘talking the talk’ (<a

                    (which they might personally regard as ‘bullshit’) to get
                    the attention of their superiors. It can involve a process
                    of one-upmanship whereby a listener responds with additional
                    bullshit which is even more empty and more misleading than
                    the initial offering. For instance, sailors talking in a
                    group frequently tell increasingly tall stories about their
                    exploits on previous voyages (<a

                    >). A third way people can respond is by believing the
                    bullshit. This is when a person listening to a bullshitter
                    mistakes what they are saying as being an approximation of
                    the truth. In many language games of bullshitting, this is a
                    sign that the listener is naïve and does not understand the
                    game being played. For instance, in his study of
                    hitch-hikers,
                    <a

                    found that young and naïve hitch-hikers would often mistake
                    the bullshitting of older hitch-hikers for truth statements.
                    This unwarranted belief marked the young hitch-hikers out as
                    neophytes who did not completely understand the culture and
                    were not fully fledged participants in the game of
                    bullshitting. A final response to bullshitting is negation.
                    This is when someone ‘calls bullshit’ by pointing out the
                    false or misleading nature of a statement. Calling bullshit
                    can be an abrupt act where someone simply responds ‘that’s
                    bullshit’ and in doing so closes down space for inquiry and
                    justification. This kind of response can be found in online
                    debates about political issues. In other cases, bullshit can
                    be called in a more careful way through exploring a claim,
                    charting out why it might be considered bullshit and what
                    might be done to make it less bullshit. An example of this
                    careful calling out of bullshit is Rudolph Carnap’s
                    interrogation of Martin Heidegger’s phrase ‘the nothing
                    nothings’ (<a

                    participating, actors can keep the interaction going in a
                    polite way. For instance, if an audience member remains
                    relatively silent while their boss spouts bullshit, the
                    social relationship is likely to remain intact. If an actor
                    shows that they actually buy into bullshit and begins to
                    mistake it for a truth claim, then it is likely they will
                    either be sidelined from the bullshit game or given some
                    subtle signals (either from the bullshitter or other
                    listeners) that they should not take it so seriously. This
                    kind of re-orienting work helps to bring the bullshitter
                    back on track. Finally, when a listener actively calls
                    bullshit on a speaker, it can disturb the surface-level
                    agreement between people. The bullshitter can seek to repair
                    this surface-level agreement through strategies such as
                    evasive bullshitting, whereby they answer a fairly direct

                    senior executives of some of Britain’s largest banks were
                    asked to testify in front of a committee of the UK
                    Parliament. When the bankers were quizzed about their
                    responsibility for the crisis, many responded with evasive
                    bullshit. They expressed regret, claimed they had already
                    apologized and shifted blame to others (<a

                    kept asking questions aimed at establishing the veracity of
                    claims while the bankers continued to avoid the questions.

                    There are moments when the social practice of bullshitting
                    runs smoothly. This happens when bullshitters are able to
                    continue articulating empty and misleading statements, these
                    statements are accepted (through either acquiescence or
                    enthusiastic embrace) and a degree of surface-level

                    judge statements. Instead, players mobilize different

                    the basis of whether it amused people. However, there was
                    always the potential for a bullshit game to misfire. This
                    happened if an interlocutor called bullshit and tried to
                    drag the discussion back to criteria of truth and falsity.
                    If this happened, then it became much more difficult for
                    people to continue to bullshit. It also made it much more

                    the person making a misleading claim. Self-deception enables
                    individuals to present themselves as much more
                    self-confident than they would otherwise seem if they had to
                    engage in cognitively taxing processes of dual processing
                    (holding in one’s mind both the deceptive statement as well
                    as the truth). The self-confidence which comes from
                    self-deception can aid resource acquisition. For instance,
                    entrepreneurs are encouraged to ignore their objective
                    chances of failure so they can appear self-confident in
                    their search for resources to support their venture. This
                    self-confidence can make it easier to acquire the resources
                    an entrepreneur needs, but it can also lead to delusional
                    and potentially destructive behaviours (;

                    Bullshitting doesn’t always work so smoothly. It can easily
                    misfire. When this happens, it can lead to negative
                    outcomes. It can undermine an actor’s identity. When others
                    realize that an actor frequently engages in bullshitting,
                    they may begin to mistrust them by questioning whether they
                    are competent, benevolent and have integrity (<a

                    an actor does not know what he or she is doing (and is
                    therefore incompetent), that they are immoral and do not
                    have the best interests of others’ at heart (and is
                    therefore malevolent), and that they are unable to do what
                    they say they will (and therefore lack integrity). If
                    external audiences begin to distrust a bullshitter, they are
                    likely to punish or avoid them. Their claims can be
                    discounted, resources can be withheld and they might be
                    ignored entirely. A study of CEO calls with market analysts
                    following the announcement of a merger or acquisition found
                    that when CEOs used more management speak they were punished
                    by the stock market with a lower pricing of the firm’s
                    shares, irrespective of the longer-term value the M&amp;A

                    When bullshitting misfires, it can undermine how
                    bullshitters see themselves. Failures can prompt a
                    bullshitter to reflect on the meaningfulness of the language
                    which they use. Reflection is likely to lead at least some
                    players of the bullshit game to the conclusion that their
                    chosen activity is meaningless and empty. For instance,

                    explored how employees in a Swedish government employment
                    agency reacted when the organization became increasingly
                    dominated by empty management rhetoric. As this happened,
                    many officials found themselves doing what they regarded as
                    socially useless and existentially meaningless work. As part
                    of their job, they were obliged to reproduce a large stock
                    of standardized bullshit terms. Some also sought to come up
                    with equally vacuous and misleading explanations for the
                    importance of their own job. As a result of this process,
                    many employees started to see their own work as ‘bullshit
                    jobs’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bullshitting is unlikely to have purely positive or negative
                    outcomes. Positives and negatives are likely to be mixed.
                    For instance, bullshitters could be seen as rogues who have
                    a fine image but are untrustworthy. Similarly, those
                    involved in bullshitting can start to see themselves as
                    being confident but also engaged in something which is
                    ultimately meaningless. It is also worth noting that the
                    costs and benefits of bullshitting are not equally
                    distributed. Often bullshitters try to externalize the
                    identity and image costs of bullshitting onto others while
                    enjoying the benefits. For instance, one standard move of
                    populist politicians has been to project the lack of trust
                    others have for them outwards onto other people or
                    institutions.

                    Bullshitting can create self-reinforcing or self-undermining
                    feedback loops. This is dependent on whether bullshitting
                    enhances or diminishes the image and identity of the
                    bullshitter. Such outcomes shape the extent to which
                    bullshitters are willing to continue to engage in the
                    language game of bullshitting as well as their likelihood of
                    continuing to invest in and support the broader speech
                    community which encourages bullshitting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When bullshitting enhances an actor’s image and identity,
                    they are likely to engage in more of it. One way they can do
                    this is by extending the <i>scale</i> of their bullshitting.
                    That means using quantitatively more empty and misleading
                    statements when communicating about a particular issue. For
                    instance, an organization increases the scale of
                    bullshitting when they use more empty and misleading phrases
                    in their advertising to consumers. A second way bullshitting
                    might increase is through extending the <i>scope</i>. This
                    is a qualitative shift whereby actors bullshit about a wider
                    range of issues or in a wider range of forums. For instance,
                    an organization would increase the scope of bullshitting if
                    it had previously been bullshitting in their advertising to
                    consumers but then also began bullshitting in communication
                    with employees. An implication of increased scale and scope
                    is that becoming a legitimate participant in the collective
                    conversation also means bullshitting. Otherwise veracious
                    people get drawn into using bullshit just so they might be
                    seen as having a legitimate voice in their organization.
                    Positive results from bullshitting can lead an organization
                    to invest more into the speech community which encourages
                    bullshitting. This means they are more likely to rely upon
                    the management ideas industry as a source of input when
                    making decisions, more likely to reward noisy ignorance and
                    more likely to stoke up permissive uncertainty. Ultimately,
                    increasing the scale and scope of bullshit and the speech
                    community around bullshitting is likely to lead to unbounded
                    bullshitting. This is when empty and misleading statements
                    have few boundaries and are applied in a wide range of
                    contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When bullshit simultaneously enhances and undermines an
                    actor’s identity and image, those actors are likely to only
                    tactically accept further bullshitting. While they may not
                    officially and explicitly support further bullshitting, they
                    can unofficially tolerate some degree of it. This means
                    bullshitting becomes a kind of public secret: something
                    everyone knows about, but is rarely explicitly acknowledged

                    potentially embarrassing. It is allowed but not officially
                    sanctioned. While bullshitting still takes place, the scale
                    and scope of it is unlikely to increase. While there may be
                    ad hoc and unrevealed backing for the speech community which
                    supports bullshitting, there is little consistent and public
                    support for it. This means an organization might continue to
                    draw on the services of the management ideas industry, but
                    not in a systematic or public way. It also may implicitly
                    allow noisy ignorance, but it does not publicly celebrate it
                    as a virtuous form of behaviour. Finally, permissive
                    uncertainty may be unofficially tolerated and accepted, but
                    it is not officially condoned. Under these circumstances, we
                    are likely to witness the emergence of a bounded form of
                    bullshitting. This is when empty and misleading talk is used
                    in a limited number of instances and in relation to
                    particular issues. Bounded bullshitting involves some degree
                    of self-policing by participants. While engaging in some
                    bullshitting, participants typically limit themselves,
                    thereby ensuring they are not going too far. It also means
                    they keep an eye on other less bullshit-intensive language
                    games which effectively act as a form of limitation and
                    constraint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When bullshitting undermines an actor’s image and identity,
                    it is likely to be actively punished. Actors typically
                    notice when bullshitting has a detrimental effect on how
                    other groups see them. They also are likely to notice when
                    bullshitting starts to undermine how they see themselves.
                    When this happens, they are likely to rein in or even
                    largely cease bullshitting. This may be difficult,
                    particularly when bullshitting has become a routinized part
                    of formal communication. But it is possible for people to
                    linguistically retool. It is easier to change if there are
                    alternative language games bullshitters can retreat into. If
                    bullshitting is punished, actors are also likely to curtail
                    their investment in the speech community which encourages
                    bullshit. This means they become less reliant on the
                    management ideas industry, they stop rewarding and
                    tolerating noisy ignorance, and they tamper down permissive
                    uncertainty through stricter epistemic standards.

            <p>
                Bullshitting is a common social practice in many organizations.
                In the previous section, I have argued that people engage in
                bullshitting to participate in a speech community, to get
                through day-to-day interactions within that community, and to
                reinforce a positive image and identity of themselves.
                Successful bullshitting can beget more bullshitting. When this
                happens, what starts out as informal bullshitting can gradually
                become a collective routine, then part of the formal
                organization and end up as a sacred truth. However, bullshit can
                backfire. When this happens, bullshit can become
                self-undermining. Unsuccessful bullshitting can beget less
                bullshit. If this happens, what starts as sacred values can end
                up being revealed as bullshit. In what follows, I look at how
                each of these processes happens (see

                    Like many other social practices, bullshitting can be scaled
                    up. This happens when bullshitting gradually broadens from
                    informal improvisation to become routinized interaction and
                    eventually becomes a sacred value.

                <p>
                    Bullshitting often begins as an informal language game which
                    is restricted to a small group of people. This is a typical
                    ‘bullshit session’ in which a group of close acquaintances
                    trade empty and misleading talk as a way of keeping social
                    interaction going (<a

                        >Spicer, 2017</a
                    >). It is like a piece of improvised social theatre where
                    the participants are the only audience. Just like in a
                    theatre performance (or other fictional narrative),
                    participants are willing to suspend their disbelief and take
                    on a part so the performance can proceed. They are willing
                    to put aside critical questioning and proceed as if bullshit
                    contained some degree of truth. Once players have put aside
                    typical criteria for assess truth claims, they need to
                    engage in a process of interpretation. This entails
                    understanding what is happening in a social setting where
                    typically standards of truth might no longer apply. After
                    developing an understanding of what is going on, a would-be
                    bullshitter moves from being a peripheral passive
                    participant who sits and listens to become someone who is
                    actively involved. This requires some degree of
                    synchronization. The bullshitter has to align their own
                    actions and words with those of others (<a

                    themselves and push the language game on by adding to it.

                    study of street prostitutes in Vancouver. When she began
                    studying these women, she realized that she had to suspend
                    her usual skepticism about their claims if she really wanted
                    to understand their world. Although she spent many months
                    studying these women, she remained uncertain about when they
                    were bullshitting her, when they were saying something
                    truthful, and when they were outright lying. Layton found
                    that understanding what was bullshit and what was not proved
                    to be very difficult to determine. She lacked the deep
                    insider knowledge required to make such judgements. As she
                    learned more about the lifeworld of the prostitutes, she
                    learned that truth and bullshit often were closely woven
                    together. A good understanding of the culture enabled her to
                    discern the ‘street wisdom’ which was often passed on
                    through bullshitting.

                    Over time, improvising bullshit is likely to become a
                    routine. One way this process of routinization happens is
                    through learning. By repeated exposure to and use of
                    bullshit, people become accustomed to both the script and
                    how it should be performed. This is what happened when

                    slowly learned that many shocking tales she was told about
                    violence and murder were often little more than ‘trash talk’
                    which shouldn’t be taken too seriously. Over time she
                    learned how to play her role in this trash talking as well.
                    A second way bullshitting can become routinized is through
                    anticipation. Anticipation involves co-ordinating future
                    action in a way which is shaped by a feel for what will

                    interaction, they also start to organize and act
                    accordingly. One way is by taking prophylactic measures to
                    protect themselves from bullshitting. For instance,
                    increasing concerns about ‘fake news’ have led many media
                    organizations to anticipate that at least some of the
                    information they use will have a bullshit-like quality.
                    Anticipating bullshit, many media companies have put in
                    place prophylactic measures such as independent fact

                    Over time, routinized bullshitting can gradually become
                    built into the formal organization. When this happens,
                    bullshitting become part of the official
                    <i>lingua franca</i> of an organization. One way this can
                    happen is through pseudo-theorizing. Theorization provides a

                    theorizing (such as technical experts and scientific
                    language) is present but substantive processes of

                    is when experts with apparently legitimate credentials are

                    mystical foundations were often obscured through the use of

                    sanctioning. This entails people in positions of authority
                    (either within or outside the organization) deeming
                    particular forms of bullshitting to be acceptable in
                    important organizational forums such as official meetings,
                    internal communications and reports. Bullshitting can be
                    actively sanctioned through authoritative individuals
                    modelling the use of the language themselves, bullshit being
                    encoded in internal guides and templates, and bullshitting
                    being passively sanctioned in organizations. Finally,
                    bullshitting becomes formalized through publicizing. This is
                    when bullshitting which is common inside an organization
                    starts to be used in external communication. This is
                    particularly important when bullshitting is either taken up
                    in external communication by high-profile figures or spoken
                    in the collective voice of organization. An example of the
                    former is when a CEO begins to use empty and misleading
                    terms which are common inside the organization in
                    communication with important external audiences such as
                    analysts, the media or politicians.

                    When bullshit has become part of the formal organization for
                    some time, it can slowly start to seem valuable in and of
                    itself. When this happens, bullshit can be treated as
                    sacred. Sanctification happens when an element of secular
                    life (such as bullshitting) is elevated, a sense of higher
                    meaning is projected into it, and deep existential

                    inspired almost religious reverence and was used to speak
                    about almost anything from product design to human resource

                    legitimated by wider institutions. This happens when
                    meaningless terms are embedded within commonly accepted
                    practices, rules and cognitive schemes. When this happens,
                    what was previously bullshitting within a particular
                    organization can begin to seem like something which is
                    inevitable and highly valuable across an entire field. For
                    instance, within the cultural sector in the United Kingdom,
                    a wide range of empty terms such as ‘creativity’ began to be
                    used by actors in increasingly reverential terms (<a

                <p>
                    Bullshitting doesn’t always work. In the previous section, I
                    argued that bullshitting can misfire and undermine a
                    bullshitter’s image and identity. When this happens,
                    bullshit can be undermined and become a less important part
                    of social processes. In organizational contexts,
                    bullshitting can be undermined through four processes:
                    failed improvisation, de-routinization, de-formalization and
                    de-sacrilization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way by which nascent bullshitting de-escalates is when
                    improvised social interaction fails. For instance,
                    improvisation can fail when an actor doesn’t suspend their
                    disbelief and puts aside concerns about the truthfulness of
                    a statement to let social interaction flow. For instance, a
                    participant in a meeting may resist being swept up in a
                    presentation filled with management buzzwords and ask for
                    precise understandings of how this will work operationally.
                    When this happens, resolute disbelief can become a
                    significant barrier to ongoing bullshitting. A second way
                    improvisation can be undermined is through misunderstanding.
                    This happens when an actor doesn’t fully ‘get’ that they are
                    involved in a bullshit session. When this happens, they
                    might mistake bullshitting for outright lies or even
                    statements of truth. For instance, novice hitch-hikers
                    sometimes think the tall tales of ‘old hands’ are statements
                    of truth (<a

                        id="focusIdbibr86-2631787720929704367"

                        >Mukerji, 1978</a
                    >). Although this could be momentarily amusing, it often
                    proved to be awkward. A final way that improvised
                    bullshitting can be undermined is through linguistic
                    incompetence. For bullshitting to work, you need to have at
                    least some level of skill in pulling together claims. When
                    bullshit is poorly cobbled together, the emptiness and
                    misleading nature of much of the language is likely to spark
                    a backlash against the bullshitter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When bullshitting becomes part of the routine processes in
                    an organization, it is more likely to be undermined through
                    de-routinization. One way this happens is through
                    unlearning. This occurs when actors consciously question the
                    bullshit they use in an unthinking way. For instance, if a
                    management buzzword is identified as bullshit, actors have
                    to consciously reflect on their language and find
                    alternatives. A second way routine bullshitting can be
                    undermined is through anticipatory defence. This means
                    actors who expect bullshitting will put in place
                    prophylactic measures to protect themselves. This is what
                    happened in the media industry. A few high-profile scandals
                    concerning journalists making up stories led to large-scale
                    efforts to expand routine ‘fact checking’ in news production
                    process (<a

                    >). A final way routinized bullshit can be interrupted is
                    through de-reification. This is when seemingly objective
                    categories and processes are revealed to be contingent and
                    subjective (<a

                    >). This happens during shocks or crises in an organization,
                    when an organization comes into contact with alternative
                    speech communities, and when outsiders disturb the existing
                    speech community.

                <p>
                    As well as undermining routinized bullshitting, actors can
                    question bullshit which has been integrated into the formal
                    structures of an organization. This happens through the
                    process of de-formalization where what appeared as
                    legitimate organizational processes are shown to be
                    illegitimate. One way this process can occur is through
                    theorizing. This is when claims which appear to have a
                    rational gloss are subjected to deeper and more searching
                    inquiry by experts. For instance, overblown claims about the
                    effectiveness of a management technique may be deflated
                    through careful empirical tracking of actual impacts. A
                    second way bullshit can be deformalized is through
                    de-sanctioning. This can occur when people in formal
                    positions of leadership ‘call out’ bullshit in an
                    organization and question its use. When this happens,
                    organizational members are less likely to routinely
                    bullshit. Finally, bullshit can be deformalized through
                    public repudiation. This happens when an organization as a
                    whole commits itself to avoiding management jargon,
                    unnecessary acronyms and other forms of business bullshit.
                    For instance, some organizations have adopted ‘no bullshit’
                    rules. Although an organization may informally continue to
                    use some forms of bullshit, this public repudiation is
                    likely to serve as a device people can use to effectively
                    challenge the use of bullshit in the organization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A final way in which bullshit can be undermined is through
                    de-sacrilization. This entails questioning the deep
                    emotional and moral value attributed to a particular term.
                    De-sacrilization can be sparked by individual crises of
                    meaning when individuals begin to recognize the
                    meaninglessness and potential emptiness associated with
                    bullshit. Such existential explorations are likely to be
                    sparked by periods of reflection or intense experiences
                    which call into question deeply held values. An example of
                    this process is when individuals going through career
                    transitions have to question their existing values and begin
                    to see what they once thought of as sacred as ‘bullshit’.
                    De-sacrilization can also take place when organizations
                    systematically undermine the meaning associated with a
                    particular bullshit vocabulary. This occurs when there are
                    systematic and collective attempts to highlight the lack of
                    meaning or potential emptiness in a particular vocabulary.
                    For instance, organizations engaged in a significant change
                    process might highlight the empty nature of what had
                    previously been seen as very meaningful language. Finally,
                    vocabulary can be de-institutionalized by field-level
                    actors. An example of this is when a particular management
                    fad is called into disrepute across an entire field and
                    starts to be treated as ‘bullshit’.

                In this paper, I have argued that bullshitting should be seen as
                a social practice. People engage in bullshitting in
                organizations so they can fit into a speech community, get
                things done in day-to-day interaction and bolster their image
                and identity. Bullshitting is most likely to arise in speech
                communities where there are many conceptual entrepreneurs, which
                are dominated by noisy ignorance and characterized by permissive
                uncertainty. These kinds of speech communities encourage the
                language game of bullshitting. This language game entails an
                actor articulating bullshit, it being processed in a shallow way
                and a sense of surface-level agreement being maintained. If this
                language game works, then it enhances players’ image and
                identity. When this happens, they are more likely to re-engage
                in practices of bullshitting and reinvest in the wider speech
                community which supports it. If bullshitting misfires, then it
                undermines an actor’s image and identity. This in turn
                encourages actors not to re-engage in further bullshitting or
                reinvest in the speech community which supports it. Bullshitting
                tends to evolve and it can be scaled up. When this happens,
                bullshitting shifts from being a relatively informal practice
                into a collective routine, then a formalized procedure and
                eventually can become a sacred ritual. However, bullshit can
                also be undermined when it misfires. When this happens, what
                seems like a sacred value can end up being seen as bullshit.

                    >), I have argued that bullshitting is a routinized
                    linguistic interaction which takes place in a speech
                    community. Bullshitting can become, in Wittgenstein’s words,
                    ‘a form of life’ which infuses large parts of day-to-day
                    interaction in an organization. This takes the focus away
                    from particular individuals and their cognitive failures or
                    devious intentions. Instead, it reminds us that bullshitting
                    is something that fairly rational and ethical people
                    participate in because it is the linguistic norm in a
                    particular setting. Talking bullshit becomes the way one
                    becomes a viable member of a linguistic community. Calling
                    out bullshit can be difficult not just because it is
                    time-consuming (<a

                    >), but also because it involves challenging the community
                    one is part of, the language which holds it together and
                    one’s own sense of self.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing bullshitting as a social practice reminds us that,
                    like any practice, it is a product of a wider community
                    which structures and feeds it. I have pointed out that there
                    are three characteristics of a speech community that can
                    support the practice of bullshitting in organizations. These
                    are conceptual entrepreneurs, noisy ignorance and permissive
                    uncertainty. By recognizing that bullshitting in
                    organizations is driven by these wider factors, we begin to
                    see how it is not simply personal choice or poor reasoning
                    which leads people to become enthusiastic bullshitters.
                    Rather, bullshit is partially prompted by the community of
                    which one is a part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Seeing bullshit as a social practice reminds us that it is
                    not just a single linguistic occurrence. Instead, bullshit
                    often exists within a stream of speech acts. This process of
                    learning how to play the bullshit game can be reinforced or
                    undermined overtime. People are likely to be either punished
                    or rewarded for engaging in acts of bullshitting. I have
                    argued that the more one is rewarded for bullshitting, the
                    more likely one is to engage in it. This means there is
                    scope for people to get stuck in bullshit traps. When this
                    happens, it can increase the scope of bullshitting from
                    small and tolerable levels to larger, more intolerable
                    levels. Bullshit can go from a bounded activity to an
                    unbounded one. When this happens, bullshitting is likely to
                    move from being a net positive activity to being one which
                    has more negative consequences. This can create problems for
                    individuals, organizations and entire sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, by seeing bullshit as a social practice, I have
                    tried to challenge the assumption that bullshitting is
                    always something bad. Like any language game, bullshitting
                    can result in both positive and negative outcomes. I have
                    pointed out that bullshitting can undermine an actor’s image
                    as well as their identity. Bullshitting can have some
                    positive consequences such as increasing self-confidence and
                    building an external sense of legitimacy. Recognizing that
                    bullshitting can sometimes be positive – at least in the
                    short term – gives us a better sense of why people in
                    organizations may be willing to overlook it, accept it and
                    even indulge in it. In addition, it gives a sense of the
                    potential dilemmas that people are likely to face when they
                    are caught between pro-social goals (such as being polite)
                    and epistemic goals (such as seeking out the truth).

                <p>
                    Seeing bullshit as a social practice has a number of
                    important limitations. First, it is important to note that
                    not all communication in organizational life is bullshit.
                    There are many forms of communication which cannot be
                    strictly considered in this truth–bullshit–lies continuum.
                    Second, identifying bullshit can be difficult. The
                    philosophical literature offers some clear guidelines for
                    picking out bullshit statements, but these remain relatively
                    broad in scope. This means there is a significant scope for
                    interpretation in when to deem one statement to be bullshit
                    and another to be non-bullshit. This interpretive scope
                    implies that we are likely to be self-serving when engaging
                    in bullshit spotting. This means we are unlikely to deem
                    many of our own statements to be bullshit, while we are more
                    likely to label the statements of others as bullshit. A
                    wider interpretive scope opens up space for intense
                    political struggles over what counts as bullshit and what
                    does not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this interpretive flexibility points to a wider
                    problem with many statements around bullshit. The claim that
                    you can make a distinction between truth, lies and bullshit
                    assumes a realist approach where it is at least potentially
                    possible to make a distinction between true and false
                    statements (<a

                    >). However, if one begins with anti-realist assumptions
                    which regard reality as always in the process of becoming
                    and any truth claim as involving an inherent degree of
                    uncertainty, then it becomes much more difficult to make
                    clear distinctions between truth, lies and bullshit. Indeed,
                    the very act of bullshitting could be seen as a kind of
                    experimentation with the truth.

                <p>
                    My argument establishes a wider research agenda for the
                    study of bullshit in organizations. There are four
                    particularly promising questions which would repay future
                    study. First, researchers might explore how bullshitting
                    emerges. To do this, researchers might investigate exogenous
                    factors such as the role of the various triggers conditions
                    I have highlighted. Research also might explore endogenous
                    factors within a field which lead to the spread of
                    bullshitting such as social learning, incentives, status and
                    power dynamics. Second, further research could explore in
                    more depth the social practices involved in bullshitting.
                    This would look at how bullshitters try to mislead, how they
                    are accepted (or not) by the audience and the process
                    through which any mutual adjustment takes place. To do this,
                    researchers would have to look at the real-time processes
                    involved in bullshitting. Third, researchers need to explore
                    the consequences of bullshitting in more detail. This would
                    involve weighing up the positive and negative consequences
                    of bullshit over both the short and longer term. To do this,
                    they would need to ask about the impact of bullshitting for
                    individuals, and also for collective actors like
                    organizations as a whole. This would allow us to begin to
                    understand both the positive and the negative consequences
                    of bullshitting and how this trade-off process works.
                    Finally, future research could empirically investigate how
                    bullshit gets scaled up or undermined in organizations. This
                    could entail looking in more detail at how bullshit shifts
                    from being an improvised local language game through a
                    process of routinization and formalization and eventually
                    becomes seen as sacred. It could also entail looking at how
                    bullshit declines in an organizational setting. Doing this
                    through longitudinal research would give us a sense of how
                    bullshit can evolve and change over time.
